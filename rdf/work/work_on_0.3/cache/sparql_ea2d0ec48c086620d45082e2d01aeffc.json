"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?class (COUNT(?child) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?child a ?class .\n} \nGROUP BY ?class\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nIn the given sparql query, we use the provided ontology prefix to specify the namespace of the classes and properties. The query starts by selecting the variables ?class and ?child. We then match all instances ?child of each class ?class using the triple pattern ?child a ?class. The COUNT function is used to count the number of instances for each class, and the results are grouped by ?class. The GROUP BY clause ensures that the count is performed for each unique class. We then order the results by the count in descending order using ORDER BY DESC(?count). Finally, we limit the results to the top 5 classes using the LIMIT 5 clause."
