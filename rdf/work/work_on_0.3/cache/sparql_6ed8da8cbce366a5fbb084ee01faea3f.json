"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) as ?numClasses)\nWHERE {\n    ?class a rdfs:Class .\n}\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query is built to count the number of classes in the ontology. It uses the `PREFIX` statement to define the namespace `pbn` as shorthand for the ontology URI. The `SELECT` clause is used to select and return the count of distinct classes. The `COUNT` and `DISTINCT` are used to ensure that each class is counted only once, even if it appears multiple times in the data. The `WHERE` clause specifies the pattern to be matched, in this case, finding all instances of classes using the rdf schema predicate `a`. This will retrieve all instances that are classes."
