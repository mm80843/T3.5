"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?techCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n             pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroupObj .\n  ?techGroupObj a pbn:TechGroup ;\n               rdfs:label ?techGroup .\n} \nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?techCount)\nLIMIT 7\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query accomplishes the task of counting how many technologies belong to each TechGroup and sorting them in ascending order (largest TechGroup first) while keeping the top 7. Here's a breakdown of the query:\n\n1. The SPARQL query starts with a PREFIX declaration to define the namespace prefix for the ontology: `PREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>`. This prefix will be used to simplify the notation of the ontology classes and properties in the query.\n\n2. The SELECT clause includes the variables `?techGroup` and `(COUNT(?technology) AS ?techCount)`. This part of the query specifies the variables to be selected in the results. `?techGroup` will represent the label of the TechGroup, and `?techCount` will represent the count of technologies associated with each TechGroup.\n\n3. The WHERE clause includes the triple patterns to match the relationships between technologies and TechGroups. It specifies that a `?technology` entity is of type `pbn:Technology` and has the property `pbn:has_TechGroup` with the object `?techGroupObj`. Additionally, it retrieves the label of the `?techGroupObj` using the `rdfs:label` property and assigns it to the variable `?techGroup`.\n\n4. The GROUP BY clause groups the results based on the variable `?techGroup`, which represents the label of the TechGroup.\n\n5. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in descending order of `?techCount`, which represents the count of technologies for each TechGroup.\n\n6. The LIMIT 7 clause ensures that only the top 7 results are returned, representing the largest TechGroups based on the count of technologies.\n\nOverall, this SPARQL query effectively counts the number of technologies belonging to each TechGroup and provides the results in the desired order and limit."
