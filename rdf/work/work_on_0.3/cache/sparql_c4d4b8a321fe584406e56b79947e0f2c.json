"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) as ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n    ?class a owl:Class .\n    FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?class), STR(pbn:)))\n}\n```\n\nIn the given scenario, to identify the different individual 'TechGroup' to which the 'Technology' instances are linked to the 'Risk' through the 'has_RiskTechnology' property, the first step is to count the number of classes in the knowledge graph using a SPARQL query. The query uses the 'PREFIX' clause to establish a namespace for the ontology. It then selects and counts all distinct classes using the 'SELECT' and 'COUNT' clauses respectively. The 'WHERE' clause is used to find all classes that are defined in the ontology (i.e., their type is owl:Class) and have a URI starting with the provided namespace. The filter condition ensures that only classes from the specified ontology are counted."
