"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(?technology) AS ?count)\n       ?techGroup\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology .\n  ?technology pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 7\n```\n\nIn the given SPARQL request, we first specify the prefix `pbn` to abbreviate the full ontology URI. Next, we use a `SELECT` statement to retrieve the count of technologies that belong to each TechGroup, along with the TechGroup itself. We use the `COUNT` aggregate function to count the number of instances of `?technology` for each `?techGroup`. The `WHERE` clause specifies that `?technology` must be an instance of the `pbn:Technology` class and that it must have a `pbn:has_TechGroup` relationship with `?techGroup`. We then group the results by `?techGroup` using the `GROUP BY` clause. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order of the technology count, and the `LIMIT` clause ensures that only the top 7 results are returned."
