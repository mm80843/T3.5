"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?numClasses)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class .\n  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?class), \"pbn:\"))\n}\n```\nIn the SPARQL request, we begin by defining the prefix \"pbn\" to correspond to the ontology URI. This allows us to use a shortened form when referring to classes within the ontology. For example, ?class in the request corresponds to classes with the prefix pbn.\n\nWe then use a SELECT query to aggregate the count of distinct classes (?class) within the knowledge graph, and bind this count to the variable ?numClasses.\n\nTo achieve this, we match any subject ?s that has a type ?class, and filter the results to ensure that the class starts with the prefix \"pbn:\". The count is then computed and returned as a result."
