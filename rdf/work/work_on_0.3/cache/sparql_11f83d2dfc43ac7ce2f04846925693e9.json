"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?TechGroup (COUNT(?Technology) AS ?TechCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?Technology pbn:has_T ?TechGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?TechGroup\nORDER BY DESC(COUNT(?Technology))\nLIMIT 7\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we start by defining the prefix \"pbn\" to be used for the ontology namespace. We are using this prefix to indicate the source of the ontology elements being used in the query.\n\nNext, we use a SELECT query to retrieve the ?TechGroup and count how many ?Technology belong to each ?TechGroup.\n\nIn the WHERE clause, we express that we are looking for triples where a ?Technology is linked to a ?TechGroup using the \"pbn:has_T\" property.\n\nWe then use the GROUP BY clause to group the results based on the ?TechGroup.\n\nThe COUNT() function is used to count the number of ?Technology for each ?TechGroup.\n\nThe results are then ordered in descending order based on the count of ?Technology for each ?TechGroup using the ORDER BY clause.\n\nFinally, we limit the results to the top 7 ?TechGroup using the LIMIT clause."
