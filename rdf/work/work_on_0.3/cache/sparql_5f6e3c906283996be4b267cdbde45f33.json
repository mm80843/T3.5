"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology.\n  ?technology pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroup.\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\n\nThis SPARQL request achieves the task of counting the number of technologies belonging to each TechGroup and sorting the results in ascending order. \n\n1. The request begins with the `PREFIX` declaration, used to define a namespace for the ontology, enabling shorter and more readable queries.\n2. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the variables `?techGroup` and uses the `COUNT` function to count the instances of `?technology` grouped by their associated `?techGroup`.\n3. The `WHERE` clause sets up the pattern to match for each `?technology` and its associated `?techGroup`, with the first triple pattern ensuring that `?technology` is of type `pbn:Technology`, and the second triple pattern capturing the relationship between `?technology` and `?techGroup` using the `pbn:has_TechGroup` property.\n4. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the results are grouped by `?techGroup`.\n5. Lastly, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order of `?count`, presenting the TechGroup with the largest number of technologies first."
