"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?class a owl:Class\n}\n```\n\nTo count the number of classes in the knowledge graph, the SPARQL query uses a SELECT clause with the COUNT aggregate function to count the instances of a class. The WHERE clause specifies that the ?class variable must be an instance of the owl:Class. By using the PREFIX directive, the query associates the pbn namespace with the base ontology URI, enabling the use of the ontology's classes.\n\nThe query does not include specific class names as it aims to retrieve a general count of all classes in the ontology. This way, it can capture any additional classes that might be added to the ontology in the future."
