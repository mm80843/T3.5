"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) as ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class .\n}\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we use the `PREFIX` keyword to define the namespace prefix `pbn` for the ontology. The ontology specifics its full URL using this prefix. \n\nThe `SELECT` clause is used to specify the variables we want to retrieve from the query results. In this case, we want to count the total number of distinct classes, so we use the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct values of `?class`, and alias it as `?classCount`.\n\nThe `WHERE` clause is used to specify the graph patterns that data must match. In this case, we are looking for any subject (`?s`) that is a member of some class (`?class`) using the `a` property, which is used in RDF to denote the class membership."
