"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) as ?numberOfClasses)\nWHERE {\n  ?class a owl:Class .\n}\n```\n\nIn the provided SPARQL request, we start by defining a prefix for the ontology namespace using the `PREFIX` keyword. We use `pbn` as the prefix for `https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#`.\n\nWe then use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables we want to retrieve from the query. In this case, we want to count the number of distinct classes, so we use the `COUNT` function and alias the result as `?numberOfClasses`.\n\nThe `WHERE` clause is used to specify the patterns to match in the data. In this case, we want to find all resources that are instances of the `owl:Class` class. The `?class` variable is used as a placeholder for these instances.\n\nOverall, the query will count the number of distinct classes in the knowledge graph by matching instances of the `owl:Class` class."
