"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?class (COUNT(?instance) AS ?instanceCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?instance a ?class .\n}\nGROUP BY ?class\nORDER BY DESC(?instanceCount)\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nIn the given ontology, we want to count the top 5 classes that have the most instances. To achieve this, we begin by using the `PREFIX` keyword to declare the namespace associated with the ontology. We then use the `SELECT` clause to retrieve the classes and count their instances. In the `WHERE` clause, we match each instance (`?instance`) with its corresponding class (`?class`) using the `a` predicate denoting a type relationship. We then group the results by the class and count the instances for each class using the `COUNT` function, before ordering the results in descending order based on the instance count. Lastly, we use the `LIMIT 5` clause to only retrieve the top 5 classes with the most instances."
