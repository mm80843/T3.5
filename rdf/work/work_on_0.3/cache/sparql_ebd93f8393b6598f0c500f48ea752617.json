"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?t (COUNT(?technology) AS ?technologyCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology pbn:has_T ?t .\n}\nGROUP BY ?t\nORDER BY DESC(COUNT(?technology))\nLIMIT 7\n```\n\nIn the provided SPARQL query, we begin by applying the PREFIX directive to define the namespace `pbn` as a prefix for the ontology URI.\n\nWe then use a SELECT query to retrieve the variables `?t` and the count of `?technology` instances. Within the WHERE clause, we specify that we are looking for triples where a `?technology` has the property `pbn:has_T` with the object being `?t`.\n\nWe use the GROUP BY clause to group the results by `?t`, and then we employ the COUNT aggregate function to determine the number of technologies linked to each `?t`.\n\nSubsequently, the results are ordered in descending order of the count of technologies, and we constrain the result set to the top 7 using the LIMIT clause."
