"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?numTechnologies)\nWHERE {\n  ?risk a pbn:Risk ;\n        pbn:has_RiskTechnology ?technology .\n  ?technology pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?numTechnologies)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query is identifying the 'TechGroup' and its label that has the most 'Technology' items linked to a 'Risk'. The query consists of the following elements:\n\n1. First, we specify the prefix for our ontology using `PREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>`.\n\n2. We then use a SELECT query to retrieve the 'TechGroup' and count the number of 'Technology' items associated with a 'Risk'. We alias the count as `?numTechnologies`.\n\n3. In the WHERE clause, we specify the pattern where a 'Risk' is linked to a 'Technology' through the property `pbn:has_RiskTechnology`, and the 'Technology' is linked to a 'TechGroup' using the property `pbn:has_TechGroup`.\n\n4. We use the GROUP BY clause to group the results by the 'TechGroup'.\n\n5. We then use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in descending order based on the count of 'Technology' items.\n\n6. Finally, we use the LIMIT 1 clause to retrieve only the top 'TechGroup' with the most linked 'Technology' items."
