{"role": "assistant", "content": "Before classifying these risks, I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. Some of the risks seem to be related to public health, environmental impact, technological considerations, and social behavior. Could you confirm if I should consider each of these aspects separately, or if there is a specific categorization you have in mind?\n2. For the risks that mention \"green spaces\" and \"forest,\" should they be considered under the category of environmental risks or public health risks, or both?\n"}
