"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?numTechnologies)\nWHERE {\n  ?risk a pbn:Risk .\n  ?risk pbn:has_RiskTechnology ?technology .\n  ?technology pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?numTechnologies)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nIn this sparql request, we are using the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the TechGroup that has the most technologies linked to a Risk. We are using the `COUNT` function to count the number of technologies linked to a specific TechGroup. The request uses the `WHERE` clause to specify the pattern for the data to be retrieved, which includes the relationships between Risk, Technology, and TechGroup. The `GROUP BY` clause allows us to group the results by the TechGroup, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the number of technologies. Finally, the `LIMIT` clause is used to retrieve only the top result, i.e., the TechGroup with the most linked technologies to a Risk."
