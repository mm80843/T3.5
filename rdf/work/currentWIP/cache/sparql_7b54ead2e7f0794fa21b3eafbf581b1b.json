"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n              pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL query, we use the prefix \"pbn\" to refer to the ontology namespace. We then use a SELECT query to retrieve the count of technologies belonging to each tech group. We match each technology that is of type pbn:Technology and has a pbn:has_GroupTech property linking it to a tech group. We use the COUNT aggregation function to count the number of technologies for each tech group. Then we group the results by ?techGroup and order the counts in descending order using ORDER BY DESC(?count)."
