"To retrieve the list of stakeholders impacted by a specific risk, you can use the following SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?stakeholder\nWHERE {\n  ?risk a <your-ontology-prefix:Risk> ;\n        <your-ontology-prefix:impactsStakeholder> ?stakeholder .\n}\n```\n\nIn this query:\n- `SELECT ?stakeholder` specifies that we want to retrieve the stakeholders.\n- `WHERE` block is used to specify the pattern that the data should match.\n- `?risk` is a variable representing the specific risk.\n- `<your-ontology-prefix:Risk>` is a specific class representing the risk in your ontology.\n- `<your-ontology-prefix:impactsStakeholder>` is a specific property that represents the impact of a risk on stakeholders.\n- `?stakeholder` is a variable representing the stakeholders impacted by the specific risk.\n\nWhen you run this query on your knowledge graph, it will return the list of stakeholders impacted by the specific risk."
