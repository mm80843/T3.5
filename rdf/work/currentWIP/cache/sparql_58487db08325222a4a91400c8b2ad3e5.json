"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class \n  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?class), \"pbn\", \"i\"))\n}\n```\n\nIn the given ontology, the classes are represented by instances of the rdf:type predicate. To count the number of classes, the Sparql query uses the \"SELECT\" and \"COUNT\" keywords to count the distinct instances of rdf:type associated with the ontology's namespace. The PREFIX command is then used to define the namespace for the ontology, and the \"WHERE\" clause is utilized to specify the pattern of the triple. The FILTER clause is included to ensure that the queried instances belong to the specified namespace."
