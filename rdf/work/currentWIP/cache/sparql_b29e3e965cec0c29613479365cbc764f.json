"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?numClasses)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class .\n}\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL query, we use the `SELECT` clause to count the number of distinct classes in the knowledge graph. We use the `COUNT(DISTINCT ?class)` function to count the distinct classes and alias the result variable as `?numClasses`.\n\nIn the `WHERE` clause, we use the triple pattern `?s a ?class` to retrieve all the instances `?s` that are of type `?class` from the knowledge graph. The `a` keyword in SPARQL represents the RDF type property.\n\nBy executing this query, we can obtain the total number of distinct classes in the ontology."
