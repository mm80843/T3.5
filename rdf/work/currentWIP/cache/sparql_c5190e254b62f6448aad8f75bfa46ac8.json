"Certainly! Here's a SPARQL query that counts the number of distinct classes in a knowledge graph:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class\n}\n```\n\nIn this query, we use the `COUNT` aggregate function to count the number of distinct classes (?class) in the knowledge graph. The `WHERE` clause retrieves all triples where the subject (?s) is of type (?class). The result will be the count of distinct classes in the knowledge graph."
