"```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class\n}\n```\n\nThis SPARQL request is designed to count the number of distinct classes present in a knowledge graph. \n\n- `SELECT` specifies the variables to retrieve from the query. In this case, we are using the `COUNT` function to count the number of distinct classes and assigning the result to the variable `?classCount`.\n- `WHERE` denotes the graph pattern to match. Here, we are looking for triples where the subject (?s) is a member of a class (?class). \n- `(DISTINCT ?class)` is used to ensure that each distinct class is counted only once.\n- By running this query on a knowledge graph, you will obtain the count of distinct classes present in the graph.\n"
