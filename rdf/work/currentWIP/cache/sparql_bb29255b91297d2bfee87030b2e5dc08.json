"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) as ?techCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?risk pbn:has_RiskTechnology ?technology .\n  ?technology pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?techCount)\nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we are first defining the namespace prefix using the `PREFIX` clause to simplify the subsequent query by providing an alias for the ontology namespace.\n\nWe then use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables that we want to retrieve from the ontology. In this case, we are interested in the `?techGroup` and the count of technologies linked to it.\n\nThe `WHERE` clause is used to specify the triple patterns that the query should match. Here, we are looking for a pattern where a `?risk` has a `pbn:has_RiskTechnology` relationship with a `?technology`, and this `?technology` has a `pbn:has_GroupTech` relationship with a `?techGroup`.\n\nThe `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the `?techGroup`, and the `COUNT` function is used to count the number of technologies associated with each `?techGroup`.\n\nFinally, the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the count of technologies, and the `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the top result is returned, which corresponds to the `?techGroup` with the most technology items linked to a risk."
