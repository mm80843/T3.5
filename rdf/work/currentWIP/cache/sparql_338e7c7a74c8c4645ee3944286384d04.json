"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n              pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we start by defining the prefix for the ontology namespace using `PREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>`. This makes it easier to refer to ontology classes and properties.\n\nWe then use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables we want to retrieve. In this case, we want to count the number of technologies belonging to each tech group, so we select `?techGroup` and the count of `?technology` as `?count`.\n\nIn the `WHERE` clause, we specify the pattern that each `?technology` is of type `pbn:Technology` and has a `pbn:has_GroupTech` property linking it to a `?techGroup`.\n\nNext, we use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by `?techGroup`, and the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result by the count of technologies in each group in descending order (largest groups first)."
