"```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n    ?s a ?class .\n    FILTER(isIRI(?class))\n}\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query selects all the distinct classes (?class) from the knowledge graph using the triple pattern ?s a ?class and then applies a filter to make sure that ?class is an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier). Finally, it uses the COUNT function to count the distinct classes and returns the result as ?classCount."
