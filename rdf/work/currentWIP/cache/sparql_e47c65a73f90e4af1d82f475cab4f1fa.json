"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) as ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology .\n  ?technology pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\n\nIn this request, we define the namespace `pbn` using the PREFIX declaration, which allows us to use the shorthand `pbn` to represent the ontology's namespace URI throughout the query. We then use the SELECT clause to retrieve the ?techGroup and the count of ?technology instances associated with each techGroup. The WHERE clause contains the triple patterns that match instances of pbn:Technology and their pbn:has_GroupTech relationships to tech groups.\n\nThe GROUP BY clause ensures that the results are grouped by ?techGroup, and the COUNT function provides the count of ?technology instances for each group. Finally, the ORDER BY clause sorts the results in descending order of the count, effectively presenting the largest techGroup first."
