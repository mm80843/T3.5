"```sparql\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?techCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?risk a :Risk ;\n        :has_RiskTechnology ?technology .\n  ?technology :has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n} \nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?techCount)\nLIMIT 1\n``` \n\nIn this SPARQL request, we are using a SELECT query to count the number of technology items linked to a risk within a specific TechGroup. To do this, we start by matching all instances of a 'Risk' class and then retrieving their related technologies. We then link these technologies to their corresponding TechGroup. By using the COUNT function in the SELECT clause, we can count the occurrences of each TechGroup. The results are then grouped by the TechGroup and ordered by the count of technologies in descending order. Finally, we use the LIMIT clause to restrict the results to only the top TechGroup with the most linked technologies."
