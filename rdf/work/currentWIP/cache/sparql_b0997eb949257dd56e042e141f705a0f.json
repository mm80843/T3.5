"```sparql\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a :Technology.\n  ?technology :has_GroupTech ?techGroup.\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we are using the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the `techGroup` and the count of `technology` items for each group. \n\nThe `WHERE` clause filters the data by stating that the `?technology` is a member of the class `:Technology`, and it has a relationship `:has_GroupTech` with the `?techGroup`.\n\nThe `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by `?techGroup`, and the aggregate function `COUNT` is applied to count the number of `?technology` items for each group."
