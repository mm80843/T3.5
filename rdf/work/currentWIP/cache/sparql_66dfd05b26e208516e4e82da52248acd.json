"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) as ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n              pbn:has_TechGroup ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we use the `PREFIX` declaration to define the namespace `pbn` as the ontology's URI. The `SELECT` statement is used to select the variables we are interested in, which in this case are `?techGroup` and the count of `?technology` as `?count`. \n\nThe `WHERE` clause is used to specify the patterns to match against the data. Here, we're looking for instances of `pbn:Technology` that have a relationship with their corresponding `?techGroup` using the property `pbn:has_TechGroup`.\n\nThe `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the `?techGroup`, and the `COUNT` function is used to count the number of instances for each group.\n\nFinally, the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the count of technologies in each group."
