"```sparql\nSELECT ?techGroup (count(?technology) as ?technologyCount) \nWHERE {\n  ?risk a :Risk .\n  ?risk :has_RiskTechnology ?technology .\n  ?technology :has_TechGroup ?techGroup .\n} \nGROUP BY ?techGroup \nORDER BY DESC(?technologyCount) \nLIMIT 1\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we are counting the `TechGroup` that has the most `Technology` items linked to a `Risk`. To achieve this, the request uses the following pattern:\n- Selecting `?techGroup` and counting the instances of `?technology` as `?technologyCount`\n- Matching the `?risk` that is a type of `:Risk`\n- Connecting the `?risk` to its corresponding `?technology` through the property `:has_RiskTechnology`\n- Linking the `?technology` to its `?techGroup` through the property `:has_TechGroup`\n- Grouping the results by `?techGroup`\n- Ordering the results by the count of `?technology` items in descending order\n- Applying a limit to retrieve only the top result."
