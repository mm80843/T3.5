"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class .\n  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?class), \"pbn:\"))\n}\n```\n\nThis SPARQL query uses a PREFIX declaration to define the ontology namespace `pbn`. It then uses a SELECT query to count the distinct classes in the knowledge graph by matching all instances `?s` to their corresponding classes `?class` and filtering only those classes that start with the defined ontology namespace. The COUNT aggregation is used to count the distinct classes, and the result is returned as `classCount`."
