"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) as ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n    ?s a ?class\n}\n```\n\nIn the SPARQL request provided, the PREFIX statement is used to define a namespace 'pbn' for the ontology. In this case, it is linked to the ontology in question. \nThe SELECT statement is then used to count the number of distinct classes in the knowledge graph. The COUNT and DISTINCT functions are employed within the SELECT statement to achieve this. The COUNT function counts the number of instances found, while the DISTINCT function ensures that only unique instances are counted. The WHERE statement is utilized to specify the pattern to match, which in this case is any instance (?s) that belongs to a class (?class).\nOnce the request is executed against the knowledge graph, it will return the count of distinct classes present in the ontology."
