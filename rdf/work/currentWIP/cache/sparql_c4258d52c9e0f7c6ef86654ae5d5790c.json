"```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n  ?s a ?class\n}\n```\n\nThis SPARQL request counts the number of distinct classes in the knowledge graph using the `SELECT` and `COUNT` clauses. Within the `WHERE` clause, the triple pattern `?s a ?class` is used to match any subject (identified as `?s`) that is a member of a class (identified as `?class`). The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each distinct class is only counted once. The `COUNT` function is then used to count the number of distinct classes and assigns the count to the variable `?classCount`."
