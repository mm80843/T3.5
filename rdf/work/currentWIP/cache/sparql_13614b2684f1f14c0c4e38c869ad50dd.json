"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?class) AS ?classCount)\nWHERE {\n    ?s a ?class .\n    FILTER(REGEX(STR(?class), \"TechGroup\", \"i\"))\n}\n```\n\nIn the provided SPARQL request, we are first specifying the prefix \"pbn\" to represent the ontology's namespace URI. Then, we are using the SPARQL SELECT clause to count the distinct classes (?class) linked to resources (?s) in the ontology. Within the WHERE clause, we are filtering the classes that contain the substring \"TechGroup\" regardless of case (using the REGEX function with the \"i\" flag for case-insensitivity). This request will count the number of classes related to TechGroup in the ontology."
