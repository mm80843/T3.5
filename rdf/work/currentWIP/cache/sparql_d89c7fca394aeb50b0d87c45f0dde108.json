"```sparql\nSELECT ?class (COUNT(?child) as ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?child a ?class .\n}\nGROUP BY ?class\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nIn the given SPARQL request:\n1. We use the `SELECT` clause to select the `?class` and count the instances of its children.\n2. The `WHERE` clause fetches all the triples where a child is a class.\n3. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the class.\n4. The `COUNT` function counts the instances of children for each class.\n5. The `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by the count of instances in descending order.\n6. Finally, the `LIMIT` clause restricts the results to the top 5 classes with the most instances as children."
