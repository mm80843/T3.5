"```sparql\nSELECT ?class (COUNT(?child) as ?numChildren)\nWHERE\n{\n  ?child rdfs:subClassOf ?class .\n}\nGROUP BY ?class\nORDER BY DESC(?numChildren)\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nThis SPARQL request first selects the classes and counts the number of children for each class by using the `COUNT` and `GROUP BY` clauses. It then orders the results in descending order based on the number of children and limits the output to the top 5 classes with the most children using the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses."
