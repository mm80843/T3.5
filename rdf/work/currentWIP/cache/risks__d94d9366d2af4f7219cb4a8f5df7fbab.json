To do that, I'll need to categorize each risk into one of the following categories: \"Political risks\", \"Social risks\", \"Infrastructure risks\", \"Public health risks\", \"Data Privacy and Security risks\", \"Economic risks\", \"Legal risks\", \"Environmental risks\", and \"Technological risks\". Additionally, I'll need to know the confidence level in matching each risk with its category (High, Medium-high, Medium, Low)."}
