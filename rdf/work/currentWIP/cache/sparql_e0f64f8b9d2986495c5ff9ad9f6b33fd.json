"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) as ?count)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n              pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `PREFIX` keyword is used to define a namespace prefix for the ontology URI. In this case, we define the prefix `pbn` for the ontology URI.\n- The `SELECT` statement specifies the variables to be returned in the results. We want to count the number of technologies belonging to each tech group, so we select `?techGroup` and use `COUNT(?technology)` to count the number of technologies for each `?techGroup`.\n- The `WHERE` clause specifies the triple patterns to match in the graph. We look for instances of `pbn:Technology` that have a `pbn:has_GroupTech` property with a value of `?techGroup`.\n- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `?techGroup`, so the count will be performed for each unique value of `?techGroup`."
