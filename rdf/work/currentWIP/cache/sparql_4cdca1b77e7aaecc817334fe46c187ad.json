"```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?technology) AS ?numTechnologies)\nWHERE {\n  ?technology a pbn:Technology ;\n              pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup .\n}\nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?numTechnologies)\n```\n\nIn this SPARQL request, we use the PREFIX directive to define the pbn namespace for the ontology. Then, in the SELECT statement, we retrieve the ?techGroup and count the number of ?technology instances belonging to each ?techGroup using the COUNT function. \n\nIn the WHERE clause, we look for instances of pbn:Technology that have the property pbn:has_GroupTech connecting them to a ?techGroup. \n\nThe request uses the GROUP BY clause to group the results by ?techGroup, and the ORDER BY clause sorts the results in descending order based on the count of technologies in each ?techGroup."
