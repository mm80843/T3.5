"The SPARQL request would look like this:\n```sparql\nPREFIX pbn: <https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#>\n\nSELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?tech) AS ?count) \nWHERE { \n  ?tech pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup . \n} \nGROUP BY ?techGroup\nORDER BY DESC(?count)\n```\nIn detail:\n\n- PREFIX is simply a way of providing a shorthand for a long IRI - we can write `pbn:` instead of `https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/raw/main/pbn_t3_5.owl#`.\n- `SELECT ?techGroup (COUNT(?tech) AS ?count)` - This line says what we want to output - in this case we want to output the `TechGroup` and the count of the `Technology` that belong to this `TechGroup`.\n- `WHERE { ?tech pbn:has_GroupTech ?techGroup . }` - This line identifies the ontology structure that we are searching - in this case we are looking for where Technology is connected to TechGroup by the property `has_GroupTech`.\n- `GROUP BY ?techGroup` - The GROUP BY statement groups the results by the `TechGroup` meaning that we will get one result row per `TechGroup`.\n- `ORDER BY DESC(?count)` -  Orders the results in descending order based on the count, thus the `TechGroup` with the most `Technology` will come first."
