  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">During the COVID-19 pandemic, large organisations, as well as many educational public institutions, explored the potential to reduce disease transmission by dividing their staff (and students)and users into smaller groups that take turns using and servicing physical space in enclosed and high-traffic areas. The main idea is to introduce a rotating shift schedule in high occupancy areas, focusing on managing staff presence through shifts rather than the potential users of the services provided. Workers Staff should remain with the same shift group to reduce social mixing between groups of staff.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Rotating shift schedule</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Limiting the occupancy of enclosed spaces allows for better social distancing. In addition, rotating the workforcerotation of staff prevents the transmission of diseases between the majority of staff, thus maintaining the final quality of service and bringing providing more flexibility to clients.  </has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure should be used applied in enclosed and busy areas such as offices (during working hours) or large retail outlets during morning and evening rush hours and at weekends. For this measure to work, greater flexibility is envisaged on the part of the main actors - the workers - who should be willing to accept the restriction of their access.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Reduced possibility of disease transmission due to less crowded areas, less social mixing between staff groups, and reduced disruption of services due to unavailable labour.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">IThe implementation of this measure will allow control over occupancy, while maintaining the quality of services and productivity at the usual level and providing flexibility to the end users of these services.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The good functioning of the rotational shift system is based on three main pillars:
• a shift booking system that assigns workers to specific groups depending onaccording to  the specific epidemiological situation
• education of users through information campaigns about the logic of this measure 
• a robust testing and shift coverage plan for a quick response time in case of infection in one of the groups</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A number of limitations and constraints were identified for this specific measure:
•	 non-acceptance by users 
•	 change of behavioural patterns

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce companies have invested heavily in the development of contactless parcel delivery networks, particularly smart locker technologies that eliminate any person-to-person contact when the order is picked up by a special password or QR code in a dedicated room that can be enhanced with other measures to protect against transmissions. This could be extended to any GBN, especially for local delivery of goods.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Smart Locker System </has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Smart lockers allow their users to collect their goods more safely in terms of contagious disease risks, as contactless delivery promotes better social distancing. It also makes collection more convenient, as consumers can choose from a wide range of collection locations and times. From a business perspective, smart lockers allow for more cost-efficient and flexible delivery of goods as the system is simpler compared to traditional methods. In addition, the transport of goods is more secure as every single step can be tracked through automated protocols.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Due to their nature, smart lockers can be accessible 24 hours a day, leaving it up to the customer to decide whether to access them within a certain period of time, which depends on traffic, but in almost all cases is no less than 24 hours. As some other industries have realised, this solution can also be applied to their needs. The hospitality industry, as well as many large corporations and universities, are using this measure to encourage touch-free delivery of food, documents, books, etc. in areas with somewhat higher occupancy rates. As mentioned earlier, the lockers must be placed in a specific location and continuous activity must be guaranteed even when the end user is not present.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This solution ensures non-contact delivery of goods, minimising the transmission of diseases through the delivery of goods from the shop to the customer. In addition, this measure prevents overcrowding by avoiding bottlenecks caused by queues during collection or the goods being lost, stolen or broken.  Last but not least, smart lockers will reduce operating costs and provide savings for commercial properties.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The smart locker system is widely seen as a innovative way to attract new customers and/or visitors by offering them more flexibility (in terms of time and choice of delivery location) and optimised delivery of their goods.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A number of prerequisites are necessary for the implementation of this measure. These include the smart lockers themselves, the placement of these lockers, a mobile app that allows both businesses and their customers track and manage the delivery of goods, and a robust logistics plan to make delivery not only cost-effective but also flexible.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A number of limitations have been identified for this specific measure:
•	 most of today's systems cannot automatically close the locker door: it is not contactless. 
•	 older adults' perceptions of technology and barriers to interaction.
•	 non-acceptance by users
•	 vandalism
•	 need for good cleaning of the locker system
•	 system crash
•	 power outages
•	 need for strict hygiene measures in the area where the lockers are located
•	 carrying capacity at peak time - limited capacity if the user does not collect the goods quickly
•	 inability to carry large parcels 
•	 partial job destruction</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted densely populated areas. It is recognized that there is an urgent need to rethink architectural design processes and choose the right designs that can minimise the risk of contamination between users of the space. The move away from open-space concepts in separate spaces is already evident in many short-term solutions for redesigning spaces, so to take into account the reduction of contamination risks.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Adapted architectural design </has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">More and more architectural projects implement mitigation measures at the outset so that the users of the physical space can actually comply with these measures, especially in terms of social distancing. This helps avoid additional ad hoc measures if the architectural design is carried out properly, and the measures are an integral part of the building from the very beginning</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure is especially important at the beginning of the planning phase of new or renovated buildings and spaces. There is a consensus that the trend is towards larger and less dense spaces with lower capacity and better ventilation. </has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main problem solved by this measure is the fact that previous architectural designs did not take precautions to minimise contamination, especially with regard to social distancing, hygiene measures or the use of other built-in solutions.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Embedding general resilience and specific mitigation measures into architectural design will have the effect of reducing the additional costs that could be incurred in the event of a health event. As there is a global trend is towards more resilient infrastructure, incorporating this measure at the beginning of the project will certainly lead to future standards being met later down the line.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">To implement this measure as effectively as possible, a good understanding of the right way to design architecture and the related context of systems thinking is crucial. Lessons learned from previous health events have already been incorporated into a new approach to architecture in various ways, for example by promoting smooth surfaces and geometric design to reduce the problem of dust accumulation and other contaminants. </has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main obstacle is that it is very difficult to apply these features to existing designs and/or buildings. Another limitation could be the current state of the art, e.g. ventilation systems, automatic doors and other non-contact features that have only been studied in more detail in recent years. The constructuon of transmission-prone buildings can also be costly.</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Over the last years, and for several reasons, IEQ monitoring systems have become important for several reasons: 
•	 guaranteeing adequate air quality
•	 ensuring thermal comfort for users
•	 ensuring the users wellbeing
•	 provide adequate natural or artificial lighting
•	 ensuring that noise levels are not excessive
•	 take measures to reduce energy consumption
In this scenario, the application of IoT in this type of system enables the collection of data as well as the remote control of air systems. With this approach, an IoT architecture could be proposed that aims to monitor indoor air quality in buildings with high occupancy to reduce the risk of contamination.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) monitoring system</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Studies have shown there is a significant correlation between general air quality and the spread of contagious diseases indoors, as some air quality measures can be a good proxy measure for ventilation and adequate supply of fresh air. This is why CO2 and occupancy measurements for example can be considered as important. Monitoring these parameters can help decide where and when to take action in an intelligent and efficient way, for example through automatic ventilation systems. In addition, thermal, visual and acoustic comfort would always be maintained.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings. The relative transmission risk for airborne diseases would be associated for example with CO2 level, as an indicator of inadequate ventilation or of overcrowded spaces.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Apart from controlling contamination risks, continuous monitoring of parameters such as temperature, relative humidity or CO2 makes it possible to keep the environmental quality within a target range. This eliminates the problem of energy waste due to excessive consumption, typical in offices and public buildings. </has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The proposed IEQ monitoring system will first enable the detection of the rise of environmental indicators related to the spread of contagious diseases, which in turn will enable the implementation of intelligent and informed decisions and actions. In addition, ensuring the physiological needs of users will also lead to a better response of the immune system to potential infections.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The proposed architecture is based on several low-cost sensors for data acquisition and a single-board computer as coordinator, as well as on various communication technologies. The measured variables make it possible to identify unpleasant and potential risk situations and to take corrective measures. In addition, the system can use historical data to decide when to take certain actions.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A potential limitation of the system may be the limitations of the HVAC systems themselves, as well as other systems impacting environmental parameters. As a result, indoor air quality may not be adequate despite the system's measures. Morevoer, the cost for the equipement and operation tends to be high. </has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The transmission of most contagious diseases involves a variety of aspects, the number of people encountered and how it happens while walking or running being one of them. In this sense, it is well known that appropriate user traffic control measures can drastically reduce the number of encounters and thus the contribution of person-to-person contagion to the spread of disease in a pandemic scenario. One-way pedestrian control is a straightforward and effective measure that can be applied both indoors and outdoors and is suitable for the planning phase of public spaces as well as for daily operations. It essentially consists of assigning fixed entry and exit nodes in public places, and predefined routes between them as a means of regulating how people circulate.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Managing user flows in building and infrastructure </has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Person-to-person transmission is one of the main ways diseases spread. Therefore, in a pandemic scenario, better management of highly populated public places is needed to control propagation factors: ensuring minimum indoor air quality, ensuring safe and comfortable occupancy, and minimising the possibility of person-to-person contact.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to encourage one-way user flows should be considered at the design stage where possible, although they are also appropriate for existing places. The main points where this measure should be applied are entrances and exits from public places and corridors. One-way mobility should be implemented taking into account the design of strategic routes so that people's (customers') freedom of movement is ensured, at least to some extent, and the provision of public services is not affected.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This blueprint offers an easy-to-implement measure to organise the flow of people in public places (indoors and outdoors), reduce social mixing and avoid overcrowding. Staff can be trained to ensure the success of this measure.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">One-way pedestrian regulation is a measure that allows you to better control how people move around, thus controlling congestion and minimising unexpected encounters. It can also be applied in the planning phase as well as in operation and is cost-effective. This measure is particularly suitable for pandemic outbreaks where immediate and effective action needs to be taken. </has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">DESIGN PHASE: Mobility models for operators and customers can be a useful tool for predicting people flows. If possible, larger corridors that allow traffic in both directions are preferred. 
OPERATION PHASE: Information on one-way paths implemented (large informative screens, markings on the ground, maps with zoning criteria) is crucial. Intelligent entrances and exits (e.g. doors that only open when people are moving in the right direction) or badge controls are efficient measures to avoid unwanted flows of people in closed areas such as buildings;</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A number of limitations and constraints were identified for this specific measure:
•	 there is still a considerable risk of transmission as concentration of people might still occur
•	 it might be difficult to implement in small area
•	 non-acceptance by users 
•	 problematic during forced evacuations, e.g., in the event of a fire or power outage
•	 customers lose time due to non-optimal routes
•	 increases travel distance
•	 generates confusion among users
•	 increases difficulty in evacuating the building in an emergency situation</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus shifted to reducing the transmission of pathogens via contaminated objects and surfaces. Antimicrobial surfaces with inherent, long-lasting anti-pathogen properties at key contact points, such as busy door handles, are one of the measures available to reduce the risk of transmission.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Antimicrobial Surfaces</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main effect of applying antimicrobial properties to key products in buildings is to reduce the transmission of pathogens thanks to the materials in question. When communicated to users, it can lead to an increased perception of safety among users and have a positive impact on the use of the asset and its services.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The materials or coating application can be used at contact points that are used several times a day by different people ( e.g. in public toilets, entrance areas, etc.) The measure could be applied in the design phase of a new appliance,, or it could possibly be applied to existing appliances (handles, ..) in the building as a coating of the surface. The measure does not affect the original functionality or design of the product, but enhances the existing product by making it safer to use.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Keep contact points that are frequently used free of pathogens to reduce contaminations.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure is a first barrier to ward off the spread of infectious diseases via surfaces and is a passive protective measure.  This could lead to an increase in user confidence as it reduces some of the imbalance in manual hand hygiene among users.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In order to implement this measure as cost-effectively as possible, it would be crucial to analyse and find the main touch points for the application of the measure. The scope of the implementation of the measure would need to be determined and established, as this will have an impact on the possibilities of the measure.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Higher costs as it entails a more complex processing of parts carried out in the design phase or on existing products in the building. Moreover, regular inspections are necessary to ensure that the coating on parts is performing its function, which will lead to higher operating costs 
The measure could lead to reduced hand hygiene for some users, which could lead to increased transmission of pathogens for products without the antimicrobial surfaces.
The effectiveness of these coatings is still questioned by both scientist and users. In addition users may face a an allergic reaction the compounds of the coating or the coating may peel off and possibly have negative environmental impacts.</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This aims at establishing checkpoints at high-traffic locations or key nodes in either buildings or GBNs to restrict further access. Checkpoints aim to monitor relevant parameters related either to the space, such as indoor air quality or occupancy rates, or to the personal health of users (body temperature, display of test results, registration of personal presence, etc.). Based on the results, user access can be restricted or prohibited to ensure either satisfactory occupancy levels, or user compliance with health protection measures, and users can be notified of new developments when in the building.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Controls at key checkpoints  </has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The blueprints aims at facilitating the management of inhabited places, both in terms of occupancy and maintaining a high level of health among users. The measure reduces the risk of contagion among workers and possibly lead to greater client confidence.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure can be integrated into the early design phase of a new building, as well as applied in an existing building or area, if conditions permit, when there is a potential risk of epidemics. The measure should be applied in high traffic areas where key nodes lead to access to further areas, so that checkpoints can be established to potentially restrict access by users.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Restricting access based on occupancy rates and personal health measures would allow for better social distance and possibly reduce the density of infection in the building to prevent different types of virus transmission.

  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The people who are in the building are healthy and comply with the health protection measures taken.

  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It would be important to analyse and identify the main points of interest for the establishment of one or more control points. In addition, the parameters to be monitored would need to be carefully selected to ensure that monitoring and subsequent measures such as access restrictions are relevant to the situation and adapted to the current nature of the transmission hazard:
•	 sensors at entry and exit points
•	 personnel at entry and exit points.
•	 temperature sensing of the user</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">There are various limitations to this measure:
•	  implementing and operating one or more control points would be expensive 
•	 user-related checks (such as body temperature, registration, etc.) could be time-consuming and potentially cause bottlenecks. This could also lead to fewer users or customers, lower user satisfaction or hinder the desired social distancing.
•	 tests false positives 
•	 non-acceptance of increased personal monitoring by the user, for example for privacy considerations reasons

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">UV is one of the most common environmental control measures for elimination of microorganism while airborne transmission is one of the main ways of spreading many diseases. Normally, the concentration of airborne pathogens in enclosed spaces is mitigated by natural or mechanical ventilation systems. In this context, it should be noted that ventilation systems are designed for the comfort of the users, so in some scenarios (e.g. pandemic) the recommended air change per hour for controlling airborne infections cannot be achieved. UV-C can effectively supplement ventilation and inactivate harmful sources of disease before air flows reach occupied spaces.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Installing UV in ductwork</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">UV-C irradiation is an 80-year-old technology that has been successfully used to reduce the spread of microorganisms safely, quietly, effectively and economically. UV-C for germicidal spread control works primarily by damaging nucleic acids (DNA RNA) that are ubiquitous in pathogenic microbes. Effectiveness against current and future pathogens is therefore guaranteed, provided the light dose is appropriate.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">UV-C lamps are used in unoccupied spaces (either in ducts or in a room) to purify air streams that enter occupied spaces (e.g., health care facilities, offices, schools, public buildings, etc.)</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Since infectious diseases are often airborne, HVAC systems can have a major impact on the transmission of disease from one place to another. Installing UV-C light in ventilation ducts allows microorganisms to be inactivated without seriously affecting the operation of HVAC systems.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">UV-C light sources can kill viruses and other microorganisms, allowing air to circulate in a building without major changes to existing facilities, creating a safe indoor environment for occupants.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The correct adjustment of the UV-C radiation variables (intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation) significantly changes the performance of the system. Therefore, the system can be adjusted to reduce the presence of certain microorganisms as needed.
According to existing literature, it is possible to inactivate 90-99.9% of microorganisms (including the SARS-CoV virus) by installing UV-C lamps.
UV-C irradiation is very flexible and depends on the strategy for controlling microorganisms. Various analogue systems can be found on the market: In-channel systems, upper room decontamination systems and mobile systems on rollers.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">UV-C can attack certain materials, particularly plastics used in ventilation systems, so a shielding solution may be required. For maintenance personnel, UV-C radiation can be harmful to eyes and skin.  The installation of UV lamps in the ventilation ducts is expensive and requires regular maintenance, especially because of dust deposits that render the lamps ineffective. This measure is no substitute for the highly efficient air philtres in the ventilation networks, as the particles remain in the air.</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This blueprint proposes the use of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters as a means of decontaminating COVID-19 aerosols in public and enclosed spaces to protect not only from the COVID-19 but also from other infectious agents. For an air purifier to effectively remove viruses from the air, it must be able to remove small particles (in the size range of 0.1-1 um) from the air, which is the case with HEPA filters. These air purifiers can either be installed in the ventilation networks or they can be mobile and stand-alone and used in cases where installing the philtres in the networks is not plausible or in rooms where infected or susceptible people are present.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Installing high-efficiency air filters</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It is known that use of HEPA filters reduce the presence of virus particles in the air. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic a great number of studies and experiments have proven that highly efficient particle filters can capture extremely small particles, including the COVID-19 virus as well as large variety of other airborne contaminants.  </has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">HEPA filters are generally used in the ventilation networks of buildings or in certain areas where overcrowding is expected. The use of HEPA filters in buildings and areas where contamination control is required (e.g. hospitals) is an unwritten rule.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">HEPA filters are crucial in preventing the spread of bacterial and viral organisms in the air. It has been proven that HEPA filters has to remove at least 99.97% of particles from the air down to at least 0.3 microns in size. For instance, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 results from particles that are between 1 to 50 microns.  As HEPA filters can trap small particles, this measure reduces the risk of spreading disease and prevents the accumulation of further infectious particles on surfaces.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In general terms, this measure provides the following
•	 reducing the risk of spreading diseases through indoor air
•	 filtering other harmful particles such as volatile organic compounds (voc)
•	 reduces levels of allergens and mould spores in the air
•	 removes odours
•	 not as harmful as other air treatment technologies such as ionisation or ozone.
•	 reducing the risk of airborne disease spread indoors</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The use of HEPA filters is widespread and has been used in cities since the 1950s to maintain health and therefore its use in the vast majority of buildings and their HVAC networks was tested. The effectiveness can be further improved by incorporating pre-filters (to remove larger particles), UV light or antimicrobial coating (to remove viruses and bacteria) into the filter.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The limitations of this proposal include that the filter loses efficiency due to its clogging. As a result, the air supply would decrease, leading to stagnant air.  To ensure that filters function properly, regular maintenance and replacement of filters (six months in commercial and office buildings and one to two years in residential buildings) must be carried out. In addition, the main limitation is that pollutants trapped in the filter can still release small particles (e.g. endotoxins released by accumulated bacteria) that pass through the filter. Moreover, equipping the entire HVAC system with high-efficiency filtres requires higher investment and continuous maintenance.</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of converting certain spaces into health-related facilities to meet the high demand for certain purposes. In response, either the capacity of existing structures was changed or buildings (such as stadiums or exhibition centres) were converted into treatment and quarantine facilities or vaccination centres. As the demand for these versatile spaces fluctuates greatly during the pandemic, constructing buildings for a single purpose is no longer considered practical. Therefore, a paradigm shift has led the architectural industry to recognise the importance of dynamic and adaptable buildings and their multifunctionality throughout their life cycle</has_BPDescription>

  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The biggest advantage of this solution is its innovation. In order to change a building, in most cases we used to have to destroy the part that was to be changed. The destroyed part could then be reused to create a new element. But here, the scale of the recycled element is changed forever, so that a new building design can be tackled more quickly.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Architects are being pushed to design more flexible and simpler structures that are easy to assemble. Some of these structures can also be prefabricated and only need to be transported to the desired destination.

It was and is a widely used strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This blueprint serves as a reminder of this measure to ensure that all building occupants adhere to the basic requirement of good hand hygiene to reduce the transmission of disease between building occupants. Discipline in hand hygiene can be increased or maintained through a variety of measures, focusing either on practical measures that provide access to hand washing or disinfecting products, or on information that reminds or guides occupants to use the measures. This measure includes development of specific hand hygiene policies and active training of the users of the buildings on the good hand hygiene practice. </has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Good hand hygiene practice</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Good hand hygiene has long been fundamental to patient safety in hospitals and in healthcare in general. By consistently washing and disinfecting our hands, we prevent the spread of infections through hand contact.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Hand sanitizers should be available at all key points in the building. This could be at the entrances to the building/premises/populated space, at the entrances and exits of stairwells, in canteen areas, at high use areas such as coffee and vending machines, etc Information and instructions for users, e.g. signs at toilets indicating good hand hygiene, reminders to use hand sanitizers at strategic locations, etc.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The aim of this design is to reduce the transmission of diseases through direct hand-to-hand contact between users or the transmission of diseases through surfaces (fomites).</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Implementing measures to ensure high hand hygiene is a low-tech measure to reduce infection risks. These measures are easy to implement and easy to withdraw, which gives them a short response time and high flexibility, also with regard to later relocation in the building.
Implementation and operating costs are relatively low compared to more technically complex and comprehensive measures.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">For effective implementation of this measure, it is important to assess the primary user group(s) of the building and the impact of their characteristics on the measures to be implemented.  For example, the measures in a kindergarten would be very different from those on a university campus.  Therefore, it is important to assess this so that the information and active measures are targeted to the current user group to achieve the greatest impact 
Hand hygiene can be monitored directly through user observation or self-reporting, or indirectly by monitoring the consumption of disinfectants (soap and hand sanitizer).</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Changing user behaviour can be challenging, but once a positive behaviour is established, it is easier to maintain.

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This blueprint aims to reduce the number of physical contact points in the building where microbes have been shown to survive, such as surfaces, railings, doorknobs etc. This allows building occupants to avoid touching as many of the same surfaces and physical points as possible, which reduces the risk of contamination. This can be done through a whole range of measures, such as 
•	 installing foot- or sensor-operated door openers on common doors 
•	 updating/retrofitting commonly used equipment such as toilet flushes, coffee machines, vending machines, lift interfaces, taps to a touch-free version
•	 encouraging users to avoid touching shared surfaces 
•	 installing motion-sensing lighting to reduce touching of light switches</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Reducing contact points</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Many pathogens are transmitted by touching contaminated objects, known as fomites. Reducing the number of shared surfaces that people touch, especially high-traffic contact points, will help to reduce the infection risk for fomite-transmitted diseases even during normal, non-pandemic times, helping to keep people healthy.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The aim is to reduce possible cross-contamination points in the building by applying non-contact measures and solutions, especially at highly frequented contact points in the building.
These can be, for example toilet flushes or door handles at central locations with high activity or widely used devices at key points, but also contactless vending machines.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It has been proven that some diseases (such as chicken pox, common cold or Hepatitis A and B) spread among buildings’ users through transmission via physical contact points and surfaces</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Many of the measures to reduce contact points are low-tech and low-cost measures that can be implemented in existing buildings as well as in new buildings.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As these measures are already widely used in different contexts, there are a variety of products on the market to meet the needs, as well as a growing catalogue of solutions that include touch-free elements that vary from those widely used such as water taps or lights to more innovative ones such as elevators, coffee machines or doors. </has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Existing systems may require certain physical contacts (as with fingerprint solutions).
In addition, stakeholders who physically work in the building cannot exclude physical contact from their daily activities. Sensor control of functions that do not consume energy, such as opening doors, would lead to a small increase in energy consumption. On the other hand, sensor control of lighting, e.g. depending on the presence of staff, would lead to a decrease in energy consumption. Certain contactless technologies (such as facial recognition) could pose an increased risk to privacy or the feeling of surveillance of people and affect the feeling of freedom.  </has_BPRestriction>
  <has_BPDemonstrated rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">There is now a wide range of non-contact measures that are widely used but often have a different focus than pandemic adaptation. Sensor control of lighting and doors, for example, is often used in buildings.</has_BPDemonstrated>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This blueprint aims to integrate access to green space into GBN in order to improve or maintain the mental health status of GBN users. The term green space is usually defined as open, undeveloped land with natural vegetation, but is also used in other forms such as urban parks and public open spaces, as well as street trees and green spaces. The use of green space has been associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational studies, demonstrating a positive impact of green space on a wide range of health outcomes. Amongst other researchers have also demonstrated that hospital patients who had a view of a garden from the hospital window recovered more quickly than those who looked out onto a city or industrial area.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Acces to green space</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Numerous studies have found a link between spending time in green spaces and nature and stress reduction, better mood, higher life satisfaction, mental stimulation and a lower risk of mental health problems or susceptibility to feelings of loneliness. </has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Access to green space in urban areas such as a GBN is important and useful under normal conditions, but it is of even greater importance at times when the mental health of the population is under pressure, as was the case during the COVID 19 pandemic.  Green spaces should first and foremost be easily accessible on a daily basis to anyone who wishes to enter them. In addition, green spaces should be designed in such a way that they can be used for different purposes, e.g. for sports and exercise or social contacts (e.g. through community gardens, more benches or a chess table).</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Improving or maintaining the mental health of GBN users including the decrease of stress levels, reduction in depression and anxiety cases as well as improvement of the general wellbeing. </has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This intervention aims to maintain or improve the mental health of GBN users and is not designed to prevent the spread of disease. Access to green space has a number of benefits and is central to many urban projects.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In addition to mental health aspects, green spaces can also have a number of other impacts, such as positive effects on biodiversity, climate change impacts, improving overall quality and pricing of the area. In terms of a COVID 19 pandemic, green spaces would also provide opportunities for outdoor activities when people are resting indoors.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The unequal distribution of green space within different socio-economic groups is widespread, especially in urban areas. A number of studies have shown that people living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods have symmetrically different access to and quality of green space. Furthermore, the development of green spaces in areas with residents of lower socio-economic status can lead to an increase in property prices and thus accelerate gentrification.</has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Animal vector control methods and technologies are central to preventing the transmission of vector-borne diseases from animals to occupants (zoonosis) and users of buildings and/or GBN. More traditional methods of controlling animal vectors in buildings include the large-scale use of pesticides and insecticides. However, there is a trend towards less toxic measures in EU countries. As a result, several countries have introduced more complex pest control strategies that include several non-chemical approaches. Integrated Pest Management (IPM), for example, is, as the title suggests, a programme that uses more than one technique at four levels of implementation: 
•	 identify the pest species that occur in a given area in order to take targeted preventive measures (see below). in addition, this phase includes routine monitoring of the most infested areas and an analysis of the effectiveness of the measures applied
•	 establishment of thresholds for the implementation of certain measures to enable informed decision-making.
•	 prevention
•	 application of the lowest risk pest control methods such as trapping, eradication or local application of pesticides and insecticides if non-toxic methods have not brought the success determined by the thresholds</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Animal vectors control  measures</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic (e.g. dengue fever, malaria, West Nile virus), care should be taken to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate their breeding sites within infrastructure. Climate change will extend the range of disease-carrying mosquitoes further north, so that malaria could also pose a threat in southern Europe in the coming decades. In addition, COVID -19 was the most recent example of a zoonosis spreading worldwide, but other diseases such as the Zika virus, dengue fever and SARS are also among the epidemics. According to 2016 UNEP estimates, about 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from animals. In addition, numerous studies confirm the hypothesis that animals that choose the urban environment as their natural habitat, especially rodents, insects and birds, carry significantly greater amounts of pathogens than animals in other habitats.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure is to be applied in all GBN buildings, but it is known that some categories of buildings or certain areas within buildings (such as storage areas, low-quality shelters or eating areas) are more susceptible to the occurrence of animal vectors 
Examples of mosquito control would be:
•	 fly screens on opening windows
•	 air curtains on external doors (if fitted - in most cases this is neither cost nor energy efficient)
•	 preventing accumulations of standing water (e.g. containers where rainwater can collect, blocked gutters)
In addition, rodents such as mice and rats can carry diseases such as hantaviruses. To prevent rodent infestation of a building, it is important to keep it clean, including
•	 removing potential nesting material (e.g. shredded paper, dried plant debris)
•	 storing waste (especially food waste) in containers with tight-fitting lids
•	 storing food in thick plastic or metal containers with tight-fitting lids
•	 sealing cracks or holes in external walls</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Continuous control of animal vectors prevents infestations and thus reduces the risk of spreading diseases and other health risks such as severe allergic reactions or asthma attacks. In addition, the risk of property damage will be much lower.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The implementation of IMP or other integrating measures that opt for rather non-toxic and innovative solutions will not only reduce the risk of disease spread among building occupants, but will also lead to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transformation. Pest control will also lead to significant cost savings, as even a small infestation can lead to high investments.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A sound and comprehensive management plan to control animal vectors is as important as training for building occupants and technical staff, including pest prevention and control professionals.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main obstacle to effective prevention and control of animal vectors is the inability or even lack of knowledge exchange between trained professionals, as well as the lack of expertise in non-traditional methods, which are still widely used in many EU countries. Furthermore, innovation in this particular sector cannot be considered rapid and there are currently not many alternatives to traditional methods. Moreover, training of personnel migh be costly and use of toxic pesticides and insecticides can harm the environment. </has_BPRestriction>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The general idea described above is to use technology to monitor whether people in a building or other enclosed space are using personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks. This can be done through various methods, including video surveillance, access control systems, mobile apps and temperature controlsThe aim of these methods is to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in the building by mandating the use of PPE and protecting the health and safety of people using the building. It is important to note that the use of technology to monitor the use of PPE should be done in a way that respects the privacy and autonomy of the people using the building. Building owners should ensure that any technology used is transparent, secure and properly managed to protect personal data and prevent abuse.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tracking and enforcing use of Personal Protective Equipment </has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks can help reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Wearing a face mask can protect both the person wearing the mask and those around them by preventing the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain viruses. In a building or other enclosed space, it can be particularly important to wear a face mask to protect against the transmission of infectious diseases. Buildings often have many people in a confined space and air circulation can not be optimal, making it easier for respiratory diseases to spread, in particular through droplets. By mandating the use of PPE, building owners and managers can help reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission and protect the health and safety of people using the asset.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Different approaches can be taken. CCTV uses cameras to monitor the use of PPE in common areas of the building. Access control systems require individuals to scan a face mask or other PPE before entering the building. Mobile apps allow people to scan a QR code or use a facial recognition system to confirm they are wearing a face mask before entering the building. Temperature checks use thermal imaging cameras or other temperature control devices to detect fever, which can be a symptom of COVID-19.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The problem this blueprint addresses is the possible spread of infectious diseases in buildings or other enclosed spaces where people are in close quarters and air circulation may be poor. By mandating the use of PPE, building owners and managers can help reduce the risk of transmission and protect the health and safety of people using the building.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The use of technology can help minimise the risk of human error and reduce the workload of the building employee who might otherwise be responsible for manually monitoring the use of PPE. Ultimately, the benefit of using technology to address this issue is that it can help to more effectively protect the health and safety of people using the building by reducing the risk of infectious disease transmission. This can be built upon: for example, CCTV images can be analysed to measure social distancing in different context (external/in the street, or in an enclosed space).</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Building owners and managers can use technology to check if inhabitants are using personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks. Some options include:
•	 video surveillance: Building owners can use video surveillance cameras to monitor whether people are wearing face masks in common areas of the building.
•	  access control systems: Building owners can set up access control systems that require people to scan a face mask or other PPE before entering the building.
•	 mobile app: Building owners can develop a mobile app that allows inhabitants to scan a QR code or use a face recognition system to confirm that they are wearing a face mask before entering the building.
•	 temperature screening: Building owners can use thermal cameras or other temperature screening devices to check for fever, which can be a symptom of COVID-19.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Still, PPE alone is not sufficient to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. Other measures, such as maintaining physical distance, frequent hand hygiene and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, are also important to reduce the risk of transmission.
Moreover, it is important to note that the use of technology to monitor PPE usage should be done in a way that respects the privacy and autonomy of the people using the building. Building owners should ensure that any technology used is transparent, secure, and properly managed to protect personal information and prevent abuse Enforcing the use of PPE may provoke resentment , face PPE impacts communication, environmental footprint of PPE usage</has_BPRestriction>

  <rdfs:label rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Infection tracking</rdfs:label>
  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tracking and surveillance of infections allows better assessment of the spread of an epidemic in real time. Depending on the extent of surveillance and tracking, this method will allow the determination of characteristic elements of the epidemic, such as its virulence factor and infectivity. This will enable real-time risk assessment, which is critical for decision-making to ensure the safety of GBN residents. It is expected that a clear testing and surveillance strategy would be adapted at GBN and/or building level and applied in the event of a pandemic. Potential disease tracking would be achieved through the use of rapid antigen testing to rapidly identify some very infectious individuals and PCR testing for individuals who have been in close contact with an infected person.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Infection tracking</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tracking infections is useful in the first phase of the spread of an epidemic, especially if it is a new contagious event. However, tracking first requires establishing a case definition of when a person is considered infected. Once this starting point is established, tracking the disease spread provides information on transmission routes, transmission rates, virulence and consequences of the disease. This initial information will serve as the basis for developing (or adapting) the response plan to ensure the safety of GBN residents. In a second phase, infection monitoring supports the evaluation of the effectiveness of the response plan and thus the hopefully declining spread of the epidemic based on the same case definition as in the tracking phase. This includes the identification of persons who have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for a disease with a higher transmission potential.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Depending on the case definition, infection tracking and surveillance for non-residents could be done every time they enter a GBN, while tracking and surveillance for residents in GBNs could be updated daily, regardless of whether they have spent the entire last 24 hours in a GBN or not. </has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As far as tracking and surveillance of infections is concerned, the challenge lies in the efficiency and reliability of tracking and surveillance methods and devices. These are directly related to case definition and thus knowledge of the disease. However, if it is an unknown or new epidemic, the case definition cannot be accurately confirmed, creating grey areas where the epidemic can spread unnoticed.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Infection tracking and monitoring is a robust decision-making tool that supports the implementation and updating of the security strategy in the event of an epidemic by providing real-time data that is critical in such an event.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Tracking and surveillance of infections must be efficient by tracking and monitoring diseases in all residents of the GBN, but also in all persons who enter the GBN during the day, whether for a delivery, a job or a service. The tracking and surveillance material should be able to detect common infectious viruses or bacteria as well as all types of registered epidemic diseases. In addition, the system needs to be updated as soon as health authorities report a new disease or outbreak. The use of robots capable of diagnosing a disease is also on the rise and it is expected that the need for human resources for testing purposes will be less.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The restrictions and limitations of this proposal primarily concern data collected through tracking and surveillance. These data, in particular individual identity and health status, should only be used for their original purpose, namely tracking and surveillance of infections and nothing else. The effectiveness of tracking also relies heavily on a quick responsiveness which was not always the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other limitation contain: 
•	 the cost of testing and analysis of subsequent data
•	 the cost of tracking of infected people
•	 the environmental impact from the plastic waste from the disposables
•	 testing can be inaccurate and can give false sense of security or vice-versa.</has_BPRestriction>
  <has_BPDemonstrated rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">During the outbreak of COVID -19 this method was frequently used and proved to be efficient.</has_BPDemonstrated>

  <rdfs:label rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Drinking water safety - biofilm formation</rdfs:label>
  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Fortunately, most tap water in Europe and North America is drinkable and of very good quality. Nevertheless, there is evidence that treated water contains a small amount of microorganisms. These microorganisms adhere to the side walls of the pipes and form so-called biofilms. The growth of biofilms mainly affects the turbidity, taste, odour and colour of the water and in many cases promotes the degradation of disinfectant residues. On the other hand, several studies have shown that these effects are exacerbated during stagnation.
Considering that during the pandemic many public facilities remained closed for long periods of time, this fact is worrying and a cause for concern, especially when the buildings reopen. This concept involves the use of activated carbon philtres at strategic points in the pipe networks to improve taste and eliminate the risk of contamination, as well as the installation of optical biofilm sensors in the water distribution systems of GBNs to monitor the formation of biofilms. In this way, scheduled pipe cleaning can be carried out, limiting the negative impact of biofilms on drinking water quality and safety.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Drinking Water Safety - Biofilm formation</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Activated carbon filtres are cost-effective solutions that retain impurities as the water flows through them. In addition, these systems improve taste and can be installed by almost anyone.
On the other hand, the growth of biofilms in drinking water distribution networks has been shown to affect water properties and, in many cases, promote the deterioration of disinfectant residues. The growth of biofilms in distribution systems also increases flow resistance and affects the hydraulic efficiency of the network in the long term. In addition, biofilms in many cases excrete substances that attack concrete and metal pipes.
Continuous monitoring of biofilm growth in distribution systems is the only way to get a handle on these problems and take action when biofilm formation exceeds a certain threshold. For their part, the activated carbon filtres prevent pathogens from reaching the consumer when a thin biofilm layer is present.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This measure is to be implemented in all buildings of the GBNs. The sensors are to be installed at various locations along the distribution lines of each GBN.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Currently, the most widely used method to combat the growth of biofilms in distribution networks is the use of chlorine. This compound is usually dosed in excess, which has a negative impact on the chemical and aesthetic quality of the drinking water. This approach, on the other hand, allows for the timely application of other, more effective control measures (cleaning measures), as well as the response to unforeseen changes in operating conditions that could promote biofilm growth.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In general, BP can be used to monitor the attachment of biofilms, which provides meaningful information for optimising the parameters of distribution systems. On the other hand, activated carbon philtres remove all kinds of impurities that may still be present in tap water.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This BP is essentially based on continuous monitoring of biofilm growth in distribution networks. Today, there are several devices that can be installed either directly in the river or in a bypass line to assess this problem. Examples of these devices are optical biofilm sensors and electrochemical sensors. This measure again requires activated carbon filtres to eliminate the risk of contamination of household water.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Monitoring biofilm growth in water distribution systems is not a simple, time-consuming or costly procedure. The cost of installing and setting up such a monitoring system is not just a one-off cost. Continuous monitoring requires maintenance and handling costs that may limit the implementation of this measure.</has_BPRestriction>

  <rdfs:label rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Drinking water safety - restoring water quality in buildings after forced closure</rdfs:label>
  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">During the Covid 19 pandemic, many buildings stood empty and were hardly used or not used at all. In addition, the lack of personnel in many cases led to a standstill in the maintenance of the water network. Under these conditions, standing and untreated water may no longer be potable or used for domestic or commercial purposes due to the growth of various pathogens and the depletion of disinfectants. In addition, changes in water chemistry can increase corrosion and leaching of metals such as lead and cause the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products. In this case, preventive measures must be taken to allow safe resumption of operation after a prolonged period of stagnation.
This BP describes a general procedure for the quality of drinking water in buildings before they are reopened in order to increase the resilience of the drinking water network, which includes the following steps: 
1) Inspection of the components of the water system, including the sources, the treatment plant, the distribution pipes and the distribution tanks (if applicable). It is advisable to contact the water utility to clarify the coordination of maintenance work.
2) Check all supply and consumption spilters and water softeners.
3) Flush the distribution system and all other relevant system components. Flush cold and hot water (until maximum temperature is reached) at all water tapping points (e.g. taps, showers, toilets, fountains and other drinking water consuming appliances), bearing in mind that the flushing time may vary depending on the pipe configuration.
4) If the drinking water system adds a chemical disinfectant during normal operation, disinfect the treatment system, including the storage tanks and pipes.
5) Take a sufficient number of water samples from different sources to assess the water quality throughout the distribution system before using the water.
6) Depending on the results of the previous step, consider whether further disinfection or heat treatment is required.
7) Consider informing building occupants of the condition of the water system and restricting access to water whose quality is unsafe. In this scenario, temporary on-demand water service providers may be considered.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Drinking Water Safety - Restoring water quality in buildings after forced closure</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Safe drinking water infrastructure is essential for the proper operation of buildings or GBN. In a pandemic scenario, prolonged periods of closure can lead to bacterial growth contaminating and even clogging drinking water treatment systems if these systems are not properly restarted.
To address this potential problem, authorities recommend that building owners and managers take proactive measures to minimise water stagnation during forced closure periods and take steps to improve the building's water quality before reopening. Maintaining water quality helps to ensure that more complex remediation is not required prior to reopening.
In most cases, this problem can be solved by implementing procedures to flush and disinfect the building's sanitary facilities before reopening.</has_BPReason>

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It is well known that physical activity or exercise is essential for improving and/or maintaining physical and mental health. The pandemic COVID 19 has had a significant impact on our daily lives, not only during the strict cordons or possible quarantine periods, but also during the long periods of gradual reopening. The pandemic has drawn attention to the positive benefits of physical activity and the disadvantages of not doing it. This approach aims to integrate facilities that promote physical activity among GBN users to maintain or improve mental health. Facilities can promote both planned and unplanned physical activity in GBN. Planned physical activity can be expressed through sports facilities or other facilities that facilitate various activities such as ball games, yoga or the like. Unplanned physical activity can be expressed through building or interior design that encourages users to be more active, e.g. through inviting pathways and easy choices. The measures can be indoor measures in the individual buildings of the GBN as well as outdoor measures in green spaces or on roofs.</has_BPDescription>
  <has_BPTitle rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Enhancing physical activity</has_BPTitle>
  <has_BPReason rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">People who stay active physically, mentally, socially and spiritually have better mental health than people who don't. People who stay active feel happier and at the same time are better able to cope with the challenges of daily life. Physical activity can help maintain or improve mental health and relieve mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Regular physical activity is effective, and alternative forms of physical activity are a key strategy for maintaining mental health and well-being during a pandemic such as COVID -19.</has_BPReason>
  <has_BPContext rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Studies shows that nearly all types of physical activity are helpful and both physical exercise training and relaxation training can buffer the negative effects of stress on general health and mental health. This is important to implement in daily rutines.</has_BPContext>
  <has_BPProblem rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Improving or maintaining the mental health of GBN users so to positively impact their wellbeing and health.</has_BPProblem>
  <has_BPValueProposition rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This action aims to maintain or improve the mental health of GBN users, and therefore their general health and wellbeing. it is not intended as a mean to stop or reduce the spread of disease.</has_BPValueProposition>
  <has_BPCapabilities rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Physical activity has a number of known health benefits in addition to its positive effects on mental health. Improving physical activity can be done in a number of ways. The most common is the provision of gyms or other facilities for physical activity and related activities, but there are also other elements that promote physical activity and active travel, such as showers, changing rooms, bicycle racks or attractive staircases.</has_BPCapabilities>
  <has_BPRestriction rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An official restriction in times of epidemics or pandemics could limit the use of facilities, so that physical activities do not become a source of contamination by themselves.

  <has_BPDescription rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Water stagnation can lead to the proliferation of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and contribute to waterborne diseases. This blueprint involves the implementation of effective drainage systems, regular maintenance to prevent blockages, and community education on water management. Rainwater harvesting systems and permeable surfaces can be integrated to enhance drainage. The goal is to minimize standing water, reducing the risk of vector-borne diseases and creating a safer and healthier community. The drainage systems in GBN will be:
1) meticulously designed to accommodate the local topography and rainfall patterns. This includes the incorporation of sloping surfaces, strategically placed drains, and permeable pavements to facilitate efficient water runoff.
2) Integrating rainwater harvesting systems to reduce dependence on external water sources and contributing to sustainable water management practices
3) controled through maintenance protocols for clearing debris, inspecting drains, and promptly addressing any blockages or damage to the infrastructure that could create stagnation of water
4) monitored through smart sensors and monitoring systems to asses real-time drainage conditions (data on water flow, potential blockages and identification of areas prone to water stagnation)
5) complemented by the integration of "bioswales" to support both drainage and biodiversity objectives </has_BPDescription>
