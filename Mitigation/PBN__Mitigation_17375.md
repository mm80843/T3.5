# __Developing adaptive response strategies for vector control that consider the fluctuating demand based on infected human population size.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Aggregate average public demand for local-level vector control by authorities is dictated by the infected human population.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15436.md)
