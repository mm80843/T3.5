# __Conduct a thorough assessment of ventilation and air conditioning requirements for the educational spaces, and implement appropriate ventilation and filtration systems to ensure indoor air quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Transformation of car parking building to educational spaces may require adaptation of the building envelope for heat exchange control, posing a potential risk of improper ventilation and air circulation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14069.md)
