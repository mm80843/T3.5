# __Implement targeted interventions and monitoring in spatial clusters to contain and mitigate the spread of contagious diseases. use spatial analysis and geospatial technologies to identify and track clusters.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spatial clustering of variables may indicate localized hotspots of disease transmission or contagion spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19275.md)
