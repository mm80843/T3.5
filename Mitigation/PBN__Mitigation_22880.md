# __Combination of testing with high-quality infection control practices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)
* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Testing alone was not enough to reduce r0 below 1 but effectively reduced transmission when paired with high-quality infection control practices.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20894.md)
