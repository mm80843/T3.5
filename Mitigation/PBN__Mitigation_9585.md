# __Conduct research to determine the half-life of virus markers in wastewater and how temperature influences their persistence.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Greywater management](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_11.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of knowledge about the half-life persistence of virus markers in wastewater and its impact on sampling methods and measurement accuracy.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7704.md)
