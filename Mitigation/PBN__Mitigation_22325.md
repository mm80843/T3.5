# __Implement energy-efficient hvac systems, conduct regular maintenance and optimization of hvac systems, use smart thermostats and occupant behavior strategies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher hvac loads dominating summer electricity use patterns](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20345.md)
