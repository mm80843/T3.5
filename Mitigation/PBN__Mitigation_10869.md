# __Expand sensor capabilities to include a wider range of air quality parameters and environmental factors for comprehensive ieq monitoring.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited sensor diversity in ibem may lead to incomplete monitoring of ieq parameters and potential health risks.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8973.md)
