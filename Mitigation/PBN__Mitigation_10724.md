# __Consider incorporating dynamic factors and updated data sources into regression models to account for changing conditions and factors affecting disease spread.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Using traditional fixed parameter regression models without considering dynamic factors may lead to inaccurate insights into the relationship between covid-19 fatality rate, obesity, and the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8829.md)
