# __Conducting field studies to measure actual temperature and humidity effects, and integrating a botanical filter model in the energyplus software.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of reflection of temperature and rh effects from the botanical filter in the simulation may lead to inaccurate assessment of energy consumption and thermal comfort.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12137.md)
