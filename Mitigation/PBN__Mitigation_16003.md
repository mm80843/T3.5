# __Implement clear zoning and partitioning strategies to create distinct spaces within the adapted areas, reducing congestion and improving air circulation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of partition walls between parking bays allows for easy adaptation of large car parking areas into smaller educational spaces, potentially leading to overcrowding and congestion.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14075.md)
