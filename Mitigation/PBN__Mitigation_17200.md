# __Develop low-power sensor nodes, implement sleep mode for inactive nodes__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher cost and massive power consumption of sensor nodes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15260.md)
