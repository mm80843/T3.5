## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Hard-coded social constructs and periodic routines may not accurately represent real-world behavior, leading to unrealistic simulation outcomes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14323.md)
