# __Conduct longitudinal studies and experimental research to establish causal relationships between environmental factors and covid-19 mortality rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to make causal inferences due to the correlational nature of the study may limit the ability to identify direct causes of covid-19 mortality rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8861.md)
