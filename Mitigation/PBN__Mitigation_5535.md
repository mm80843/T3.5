# __Utilize additional data sources and modeling techniques to validate the estimates, and consider the range of uncertainty in viral load measurements.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Modeling sars-cov-2 rna copies/l of wastewater as a point estimate with a uniform distribution may lead to underestimation or overestimation of viral load.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3662.md)
