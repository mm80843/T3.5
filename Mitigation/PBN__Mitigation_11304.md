# __Conduct a thorough cost analysis that considers all factors contributing to per-assay costs, and adjust estimates for geospatial and labor cost variations.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Absorb resource shortages](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_34.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variation in per-assay costs of clinical and wbe screening due to geospatial differences and labor costs.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9403.md)
