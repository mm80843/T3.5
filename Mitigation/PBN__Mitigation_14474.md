# __Implementation of iot solutions for contactless operation and monitoring of equipment, as well as regular disinfection protocols for shared spaces.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased use of iot in industrial settings may lead to higher risk of disease transmission due to increased interaction with shared equipment and spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12556.md)
