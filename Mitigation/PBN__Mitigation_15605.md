# __Conduct frequent calibration of initial infection probability based on updated antibody test results and real case data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Hypothesized initial infection probability may lead to deviation of projected infection probability and minimum ventilation rate.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13680.md)
