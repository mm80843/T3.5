# __Implementation of a scalable iot architecture for continuous monitoring and analysis of indoor environmental quality, supported by effective management of communication infrastructures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The work describes a full iot scalable architecture aimed at monitoring indoor environmental quality inside public buildings, such as university faculties, which runs over existing communication infrastructures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6230.md)
