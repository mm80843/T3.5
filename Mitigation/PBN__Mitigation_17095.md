# __Implement centralized checkpoints at all entrances for more consistent monitoring and enforcement of safety measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited access and multiple entry points may lead to inconsistent enforcement of mask-wearing and temperature checks, increasing the risk of contagious disease spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15155.md)
