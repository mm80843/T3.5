# __Implementing occupancy monitoring systems and promoting energy-efficient practices can help reduce the risk of high occupancy and contagious disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The study involves analyzing energy consumption in buildings, which could be a potential indicator of building occupancy and human activity, both of which contribute to the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9000.md)
