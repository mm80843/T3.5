## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Uv light fixtures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_2751.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Upper-room UV lights flood the upper part of a room with high-intensity UV light. UV light is known to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria causing tuberculosis. By killing the bacteria in the air, it reduces the risk of airborne transmission.
