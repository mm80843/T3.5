# __Consult with experts to develop methods for controlling testing intensity bias, consider sensitivity analysis on testing intensity effects__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to control for differential testing intensity may skew the analysis of disease propagation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6833.md)
