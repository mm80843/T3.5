# __Focus on developing and validating effective methodological protocols specifically for virus quantitative analysis in complex wastewater and sludge matrices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Significant issues identified for the virus quantitative analysis in wastewater and sludge matrices, indicating potential challenges in accurate virus detection and quantification in these complex environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5202.md)
