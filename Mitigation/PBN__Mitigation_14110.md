# __Develop targeted uv-c exposure strategies for adenovirus in air disinfection systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Adenovirus is the most resistant to 254 nm uv-c and requires high uv doses for complete inactivation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12195.md)
