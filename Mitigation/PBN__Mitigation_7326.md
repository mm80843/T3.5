# __Invest in more experimental studies on the uv irradiation of aerosolized viruses to fill the knowledge gap.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited experimental studies on the uv irradiation of aerosolized viruses may result in a lack of understanding of the efficacy of uv treatment on airborne transmission of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5453.md)
