# __Utilize technology to monitor user position and clothing insulation, and adjust diffuser angle accordingly. also, regulate ambient air temperature.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence of air supply diffuser performance on user position, angle, clothing insulation, and ambient air temperature.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5733.md)
