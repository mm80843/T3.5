# __Use of cost-effective production methods, such as using waste biomass for production, and further research on processing techniques__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Absorb resource shortages](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_34.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Challenges related to cost and processing of graphene-based coatings at different surfaces](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5044.md)
