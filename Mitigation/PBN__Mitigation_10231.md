# __Implement measures to maintain adequate ventilation rates regardless of occupancy density, such as adjusting ventilation systems based on real-time occupancy__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reduced ventilation rate due to decreased occupancy density leading to higher risk of infection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8341.md)
