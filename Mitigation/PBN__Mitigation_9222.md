# __Consider incorporating age structure data into the model to better understand and address age-specific transmission dynamics__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)
