# __Continuously update and enrich existing ontologies, establish a standardized process for term inclusion, and implement axioms and definition patterns for better integration with clinical ontologies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Incomplete coverage of epidemiological terms in obo bio-ontologies may hinder interoperability and consistency in data representation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16115.md)
