# __Account for asymptomatic infections and vary the infection-fatality ratio in simulations to consider a range of possibilities.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assuming an infection-fatality ratio of 0.75% without accounting for asymptomatic infections.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9951.md)
