# __Utilize skip-connections technique to ease training and reduce complexity.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of dense models and multiple layers may increase the complexity of the model, making it harder to train.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15768.md)
