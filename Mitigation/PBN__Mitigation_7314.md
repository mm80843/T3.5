# __Conduct a thorough assessment of the roomâ€™s ventilation system and airflow patterns to ensure that the assumption of well-mixed air is valid. consider using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations to model air circulation in the room.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The assumption that the room air is well mixed may not hold true in all situations, leading to inaccurate calculations of average particle residence time and irradiation flux.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5441.md)
