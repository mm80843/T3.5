# __Developing and implementing general ventilation guidance for nonmedical settings, and following ashrae recommendations__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of specific guidance on proper ventilation rates in nonmedical settings for reducing infection transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17596.md)
