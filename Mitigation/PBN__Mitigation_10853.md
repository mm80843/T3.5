# __Improvement of ventilation systems, regular maintenance, and monitoring of co2 levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in the hospital building may lead to high co2 concentrations, increasing the risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8957.md)
