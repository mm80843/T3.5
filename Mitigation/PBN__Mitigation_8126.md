# __Evaluate and select communication protocols based on qos requirements, implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for strict qos requirements and performance limitations of communication protocols may lead to suboptimal iot system performance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6254.md)
