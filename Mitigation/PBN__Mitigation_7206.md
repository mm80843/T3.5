# __Conduct thorough research and testing to adapt interventions to different ecological contexts. implement a flexible and adaptable approach to disease control that considers diverse local ecosystems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Local ecological factors driving site-specific interventions may not be scalable and applicable in different regions, leading to ineffective disease control measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5333.md)
