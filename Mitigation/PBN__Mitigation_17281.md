# __Increase ventilation rates, improve air quality, reduce occupant density__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Low ventilation rates leading to higher prevalence of respiratory diseases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15341.md)
* [Spread of communicable respiratory diseases through airborne aerosols](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15342.md)
