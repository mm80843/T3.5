# __Thorough assessment of the effectiveness and potential by-products of air ionization technology before implementation; consideration of alternative air purification methods__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertain effectiveness of air ionization technology in eliminating sars-cov-2 and potential production of by-products such as ozone](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6205.md)
