# __Implement remote data collection methods or use automated energy monitoring systems to minimize human contact during data collection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Regular data collection and monitoring of electricity use in housing units may lead to increased human contact in the built environment, potentially facilitating the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20369.md)
