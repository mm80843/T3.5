# __Implementing proper dispersion techniques, optimizing layer thickness, and monitoring for aggregation tendencies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased number of graphene layers can weaken the antimicrobial activity and cause increased aggregation tendency.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5004.md)
