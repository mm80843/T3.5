# __Position air outlets to ensure good airflow without directly blowing air into occupied areas, and consider the cooling capacity of the unit to ensure proper airflow.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate airflow and ventilation in indoor spaces can lead to poor air quality and increased risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8320.md)
