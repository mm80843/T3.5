# __Conduct extensive research to determine the accurate adjustment coefficient for different virus suspension scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The adjustment coefficient c_ur for uv-c dose when the virus is suspended in air may be in a range 0.167-0.545.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5456.md)
