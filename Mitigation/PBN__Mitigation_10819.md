# __Conduct acoustic performance assessment in occupied rooms with varying hvac and window conditions to capture real-life scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assessing room acoustic performance in an unoccupied room with hvac running and closed windows may not accurately reflect real-life conditions for disease propagation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8923.md)
