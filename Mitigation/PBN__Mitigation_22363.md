# __Implement smart occupancy sensors, optimize setback schedules based on occupancy patterns, and educate occupants about efficient hvac use.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited ability for households using setback features to benefit from reduced heating and cooling energy use during unoccupied periods due to increased occupancy during the pandemic, potentially leading to higher energy consumption and reduced cost savings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20383.md)
