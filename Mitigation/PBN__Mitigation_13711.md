# __Improved wastewater treatment processes to effectively eliminate or reduce gene material in the effluent.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher gene equivalent concentrations in the effluent than the influent due to repartitioning of gene material during wastewater treatment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11799.md)
