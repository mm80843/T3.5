# __Implement population distribution patterns optimized for energy efficiency based on climatic conditions__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Optimal population distribution pattern in terms of energy consumption can reduce energy consumption by up to 32%](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17951.md)
