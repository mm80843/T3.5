# __Implement a comprehensive fault detection and diagnostic system for hvac equipment to ensure early identification and resolution of issues.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Partial building fault detection process may result in undetected issues with hvac systems, leading to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16714.md)
