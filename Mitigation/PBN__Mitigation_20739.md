# __Implementing comprehensive infection control measures that address contact, droplet, and airborne transmission, improving ventilation, and enhancing building design for infection control__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Difficulty in quantitatively comparing the relative contribution of airborne transmission with other transmission modes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18768.md)
