# __Implementing regular calibration and maintenance protocols for integrated sensor technology.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Face masks with integrated sensors could provide a false sense of security if not properly calibrated or maintained.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4723.md)
