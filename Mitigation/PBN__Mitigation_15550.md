# __Collaboration between planners and ecologists to envision urbanization patterns that do not create wuis, and regulation of activities in buffer zones.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Urban expansion encroaches on wildlife habitat, creating wuis. human activities in these ’buffer zones’ create stress for wild animals, facilitating viral shedding.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13625.md)
