# __Implementing enhanced ventilation systems, air quality monitoring, and building design strategies to mitigate disease transmission and improve indoor environmental quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Study of hvac and non-hvac loads across pandemic and pre-pandemic periods may provide insights into the impact of public health crises on indoor environmental quality and disease transmission in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20359.md)
