# __Develop algorithms for quantifying simulated output and scoring design options based on contamination and infection rate.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of quantification of simulated output leading to inability to score design options based on contamination or infection rate.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19416.md)
