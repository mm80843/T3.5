# __Implement humidity control measures in indoor spaces to maintain rh levels that discourage droplet survival.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Impact of relative humidity rh on droplet size may influence the transmission of contagious diseases in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18673.md)
