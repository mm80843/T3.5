# __Frequent cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces can reduce the risk of surface-based transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Sars-cov-2 can remain infectious on surfaces for 1-7 days, potentially leading to surface-based transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5096.md)
