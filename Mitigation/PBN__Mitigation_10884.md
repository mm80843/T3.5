# __Implementation of energy-efficient ventilation systems, use of air quality sensors to optimize ventilation, and adoption of energy-efficient building materials__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher ventilation rates required for occupantsâ€™ safety may lead to increased energy use](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8988.md)
