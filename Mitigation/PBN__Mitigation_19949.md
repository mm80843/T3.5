# __Implementing strict hygiene and sanitation protocols, reducing occupancy density, and improving ventilation systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High occupancy density in classes and the building, leading to increased risk of contagious disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17987.md)
