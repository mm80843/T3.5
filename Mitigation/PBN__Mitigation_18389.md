# __Increase outdoor airflow rates, utilize air cleaners and filters, and maintain healthy temperature and relative humidity levels to minimize the spread of airborne viruses.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in office environments increases the risk of airborne virus transmission due to the presence of micro respiratory droplets.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16446.md)
