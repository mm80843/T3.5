# __Enhanced building hvac operational practices, proper filter installation, and maintenance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for spread of sars-cov-2 in buildings due to viral particles associated with larger particles that can potentially penetrate high efficiency filters.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7841.md)
