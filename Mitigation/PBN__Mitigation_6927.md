# __Conducting comprehensive testing of go-incorporated cotton fabrics to ensure their antimicrobial effectiveness and safety.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Selection of materials](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_15.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Development of graphene oxide go incorporated cotton fabrics as antimicrobial materials may introduce new risks if the effectiveness of the material is not thoroughly validated.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5054.md)
