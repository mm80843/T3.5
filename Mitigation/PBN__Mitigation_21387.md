# __Use simulated data to inform and adjust cleaning schedules and signage locations for more effective disease control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Cleaning technologies robots](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_45.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate cleaning schedules and signage locations based solely on who guidelines, without consideration of simulated contamination frequency.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19409.md)
