# __Utilize modular and decentralized designs, create new typologies for public spaces, and implement measures to reduce social density.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
