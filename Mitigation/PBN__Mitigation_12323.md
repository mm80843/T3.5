# __Implement effective air filtration and purification systems in the design of breathing aids, and provide training on proper usage and maintenance to healthcare workers and patients.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of improvised breathing aids and devices, such as snood-type masks, without proper filtration and purification systems may lead to inadequate protection against airborne viruses.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10413.md)
