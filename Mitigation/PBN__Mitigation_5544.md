# __Develop and adopt a consensus on lod thresholds for assays used in wastewater sample testing, and explore advancements in assay sensitivity.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Differences in assay sensitivity and lod limit of detection may lead to inconsistent results in detecting sars-cov-2 rna in wastewater samples.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3671.md)
