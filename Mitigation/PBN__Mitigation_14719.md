# __Incorporate behavioral science research and user feedback into the design process to create spaces that align with human behavior and social dynamics. use simulations and virtual models to test the effectiveness of social distancing arrangements in real-world scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient consideration of human behavior and social dynamics in the designed physical spaces, leading to non-compliance with social distancing measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12800.md)
