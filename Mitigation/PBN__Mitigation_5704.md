# __Implement standardized data sharing protocols, interoperable data platforms, and automated contact tracing algorithms for rapid identification of potential cases.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Integration of diverse data sources in smart city networks increases the complexity of tracking and tracing potential infectious cases, leading to delays in containment efforts.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3831.md)
