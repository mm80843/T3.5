# __Develop uv-c dose calibration methods specifically for liquid suspension scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Irradiating the coronavirus in liquid requires a uv-c dose that is in the region 1.8-6.0 times higher than that required when the virus is suspended in air.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5455.md)
