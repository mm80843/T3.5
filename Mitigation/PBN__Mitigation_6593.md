# __Regular calibration and validation of the algorithms using diverse and representative datasets, as well as periodic review and adjustment of the decision-making process based on clinical outcomes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Algorithmic decision-making process reliant on sensor data could be influenced by external factors such as travel, diet, and other health conditions, leading to inaccurate diagnostic outcomes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4720.md)
