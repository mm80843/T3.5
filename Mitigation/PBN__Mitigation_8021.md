# __Increasing air exchange rates, reducing occupancy levels, and implementing air disinfection technologies to minimize aerosol exposure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The settling time of small aerosols being comparable to ventilation timescales, leading to prolonged exposure to aerosols in indoor spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6149.md)
