# __Careful monitoring of model performance, validation on diverse datasets, and exploration of alternative regularization methods.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Overfitting may occur due to the use of specific techniques such as dropblock and class label smoothing.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15759.md)
