# __Adopt machine learning approaches to automatically detect sound sources in large-scale social media data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Manual identification of noise sources from social media data limits the scalability and accuracy of the analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19491.md)
