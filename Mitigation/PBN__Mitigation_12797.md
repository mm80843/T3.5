# __Implementation of effective and sustainable vector control methods, such as eave tubes, eave closure, and window screening.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insect-borne diseases like malaria, hat, leishmaniasis, lf, and onchocerciasis may spread due to ineffective vector control methods.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10886.md)
