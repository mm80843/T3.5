# __Research and development of more accurate deep learning models, testing and validation of detection systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited use of deep learning techniques in object detection for face mask monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16089.md)
