# __Standardize and optimize concentration and detection methods to improve sensitivity and accuracy. implement quality control measures to ensure reliable results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential risk of undetected sars-cov-2 in wastewater due to limitations in concentration and detection methods.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5200.md)
