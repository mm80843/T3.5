# __Enhance monitoring and surveillance of antiviral drug presence and metabolites in wastewater, and develop advanced wastewater treatment technologies for removal.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Antiviral drugs like tamiflu and relenza are stockpiled globally and deployed during pandemics, leading to high proportions of communities taking the drugs in a short time window, resulting in the drugs and their metabolites being present in wastewater.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14253.md)
