# __Encourage planned urban expansion with a focus on decentralization and smaller units to reduce population density.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased urbanization despite the advice to expand horizontally and decrease densities may lead to higher risk of disease spread in crowded areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13101.md)
