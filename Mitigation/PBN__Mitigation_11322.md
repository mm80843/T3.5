# __Explore cost-effective and efficient testing alternatives such as wastewater-based epidemiology wbe to supplement clinical testing, invest in innovative testing technologies to reduce costs, allocate resources for comprehensive population surveillance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High cost of individual clinical testing for large populations may limit the frequency and scope of testing, leading to delayed or incomplete identification of infected individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9421.md)
