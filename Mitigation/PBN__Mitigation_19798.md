# __Ensure adequate ventilation and air circulation in high-humidity environments to minimize the risk of aerosol transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased humidity can decrease the inactivation of bacterial and viral aerosols, potentially leading to higher transmission of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17837.md)
