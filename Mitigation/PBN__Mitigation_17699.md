# __Thorough testing and validation of the mathematical equations, as well as double-checking the implementation in the code.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of complex mathematical equations may lead to errors in implementation or understanding.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15758.md)
