# __Validation of assumptions using real-world data and sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of different transmission scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on assumptions concerning disease transmissions may lead to inaccurate occupant exposure assessments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15459.md)
