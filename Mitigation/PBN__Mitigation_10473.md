# __Implement measures to reduce human-wildlife contact, such as barriers, education programs, and controlled access to wildlife habitats.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Positive correlation between urban wildlife support and vegetation structure may lead to increased contact between humans and wildlife, increasing the risk of zoonotic disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8580.md)
