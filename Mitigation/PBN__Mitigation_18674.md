# __Regular maintenance of cooling systems, implementation of temperature monitoring, and improvement of fault detection systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient cooling system maintenance leading to poor temperature control and potential discomfort for occupants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16727.md)
