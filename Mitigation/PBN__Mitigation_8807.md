# __Incorporation of a wider range of physiological characteristics for early detection and exploration of feature selection and extraction techniques to prevent overfitting.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate early detection due to reliance on limited physiological indicators leading to delayed diagnosis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6931.md)
