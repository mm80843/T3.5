# __Conduct regular studies on virus susceptibility to uvgi to ensure effectiveness, and utilize supplemental control measures in addition to uvgi.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Effectiveness of uvgi depends strongly on the type of virus nucleic acid, leading to varying susceptibility to uv inactivation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18109.md)
