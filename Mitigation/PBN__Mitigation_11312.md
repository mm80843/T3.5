# __Adjust monitoring results to account for the effects of temperature, particularly in long-term wbe studies across changing seasons and climate regions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Wastewater-based epidemiology wbe studies that do not adjust monitoring results to temperature risk significant under- or over-estimation of the true temporal changes occurring in virus shedding within the community.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9411.md)
