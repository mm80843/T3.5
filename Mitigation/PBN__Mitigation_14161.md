# __Design fluorescent lamps with smaller dimensions and higher specific power per cm2 of lamp body area__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence of uv-c system efficiency on air flow resistance and mechanical effects on lamps](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12245.md)
