# __Implementing proper ventilation and air filtration systems, conducting regular air quality testing, and enforcing hygiene protocols to reduce the risk of virus transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate infection control efforts leading to continuous exposure of workers to recirculated infected air in workplace environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16479.md)
