# __Use of diverse training data, rigorous evaluation of model performance, and consideration of alternative detection methods__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of selective search and region proposal for two-stage detectors may introduce potential biases in object detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15764.md)
