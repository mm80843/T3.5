# __Implementing remote continuous monitoring of patients using rfid, wearable sensor technology, and cloud computing infrastructure__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate monitoring and detection of contagious diseases due to lack of technology for remote continuous patient monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3441.md)
