# __Optimization of ventilation systems, adjustment of building design, and education on the importance of maintaining healthy co2 levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lower acceptance for high co2 concentrations in building type a compared to building type b, leading to potential dissatisfaction and discomfort for occupants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8971.md)
