# __Conduct further studies to understand ionizer effectiveness in healthcare environments and implement alternative measures to prevent tb transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher ion densities achieved in poultry studies may not be applicable to healthcare environments, reducing the effectiveness of ionizers in preventing tb transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8439.md)
