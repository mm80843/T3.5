# __Conduct thorough investigation of recovery rates for each step in the process and use appropriate reference standards for quantification.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Incomplete quantification of viral titers due to lack of investigation on recovery rates for each step in the process.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10751.md)
