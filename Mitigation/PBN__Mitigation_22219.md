# __Conducting comprehensive assessments of ventilation systems, building design, and occupancy patterns to determine the primary sources of indoor microbial contamination.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Debate about the relative importance of dispersal from outdoor sources versus conditions within buildings for determining indoor microbial communities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20240.md)
