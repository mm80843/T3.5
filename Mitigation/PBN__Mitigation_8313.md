# __Utilize advanced data acquisition techniques and geospatial analysis to accurately define grid regions and their boundaries, ensuring comprehensive coverage for disease control and prevention.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Irregular shape and data acquisition difficulty may lead to ineffective grid regions for disease control and prevention.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6441.md)
