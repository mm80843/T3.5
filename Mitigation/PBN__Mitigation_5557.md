# __Further systematic research to establish quantitative predictions, developing effective enveloped virus concentration methods, and acquiring local prevalence and concentration data__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of quantitative predictions from viral rna concentrations in sewage to actual numbers of cases in the community](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3684.md)
