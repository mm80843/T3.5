# __Allow customization of simulation time step to accommodate varying transmission rates and behaviors of contagious diseases. conduct sensitivity analysis to identify optimal time steps for different scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Default simulation time step may not be optimal for modeling contagious diseases with different transmission rates and behaviors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19429.md)
