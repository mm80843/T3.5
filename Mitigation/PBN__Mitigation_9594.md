# __Implement biomarker testing to provide more accurate tracking of infection severity and avoid overestimation of infections__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of pcr to test for covid-19 may overestimate the incidence or intensity of existing infections due to rna fragments from virus remnants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7713.md)
