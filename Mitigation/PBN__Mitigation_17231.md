# __Implement frequency hopping and signal strength optimization to minimize interference, conduct thorough site survey for optimal network placement.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on wireless communication using zigbee module may introduce interference and communication disruptions in iaq monitoring system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15291.md)
