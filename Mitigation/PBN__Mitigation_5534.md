# __Perform extensive validation and verification of the monte carlo approach, and utilize multiple modeling techniques to cross-validate the results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Incorporating uncertainty and variability in independent variables using a monte carlo approach may introduce errors in the modeling process.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3661.md)
