## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Airborne transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_252.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Natural or mechanical ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3208.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Ventilation helps to reduce the concentration of infectious particles in the air by diluting and removing them from the room. This is commonly used to reduce the risk of airborne infection indoors.
