# __Implementing advanced concentration techniques and technologies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Large sample volumes and effective concentration of virus particles may lower method detection limits.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9426.md)
