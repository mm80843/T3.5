# __Regular monitoring of indoor air quality, proper ventilation systems, and use of air purification technologies can help mitigate the impact.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increase in energy efficiency score may lead to changes in building systems and practices that can affect indoor air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16657.md)
