# __Integration of energy-efficient ventilation systems and renewable energy sources to minimize emissions and maintain air quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher ventilation rates in the built environment may lead to higher energy consumption and emissions, contributing to poor air quality and potentially impacting peopleâ€™s health.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18727.md)
