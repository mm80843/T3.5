# __Develop low-cost technology for specific, quantitative chemical analysis to improve data quality without significantly increasing sensor node cost.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Trade-off between sensor node cost and data quality in wireless gas sensor networks, leading to challenges in accurately monitoring indoor air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6241.md)
