# __Implement appointment scheduling, use technology for automated patient notifications, and create designated waiting areas for post-inoculation patients.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Constant wait time of 15 minutes for post-inoculation waiting may result in patients being in close proximity for an extended period, increasing the risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16362.md)
