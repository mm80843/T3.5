# __Implementation of alternative infection control technologies, such as laminar airflow__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Discontinuation of uvgi without alternative infection control measures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18078.md)
