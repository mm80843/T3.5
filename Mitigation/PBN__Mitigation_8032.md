# __Exploring the incorporation of dose-response models in risk estimation studies for covid-19.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Most studies of airborne infection for covid-19 have generated risk estimates based on the wells-riley approach, which may not fully account for the complexity of dose-response models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6160.md)
