# __Implement rigorous pathogen control measures in the design and construction of modular emergency hospitals, including ventilation and cleaning protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Modular construction for emergency hospitals may not have effective pathogen control measures in place, leading to increased transmission of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17652.md)
