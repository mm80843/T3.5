# __Integrate built and natural environment data with chronic disease prevalence to establish comprehensive risk factors for covid-19 transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to consider the complete pathway between built and natural environment, chronic disease, and covid-19 mortality rates may lead to incomplete understanding of disease transmission dynamics.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8824.md)
