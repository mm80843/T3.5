* [Improved water supply](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3045.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Poor access to water leads to water storage practices that enable mosquito breeding. Improving water supplies can reduce mosquito populations and contribute to reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.
