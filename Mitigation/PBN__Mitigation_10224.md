# __Monitoring and control of temperature and relative humidity, use of air conditioning and humidification systems, relocation of air-cleaning devices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate control of temperature and relative humidity leading to suboptimal conditions for disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8334.md)
