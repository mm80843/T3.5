# __Enhance quality assurance protocols for buffered measurements, such as outlier detection and data validation, before analysis__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Buffering measurements without sufficient quality assurance may lead to the inclusion of erroneous data in the analysis, impacting the accuracy of disease propagation monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16787.md)
