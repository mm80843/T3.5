# __Conduct regular inspections and maintenance of hvac systems to prevent or identify reentrainment issues. implement engineering changes if necessary to mitigate reentrainment risks.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reentrainment of exhausted effluents into the hvac system due to engineering problems can result in the spread of contaminants and increase the risk of airborne transmission of diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17576.md)
