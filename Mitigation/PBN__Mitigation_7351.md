# __Use computational fluid dynamics cfd to assess the limitations of the technology with respect to room air convection currents__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assumption of well-mixed room air may not reflect real-world conditions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5478.md)
