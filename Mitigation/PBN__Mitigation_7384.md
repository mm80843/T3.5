# __Not using amine and ammonium-based polymers for virus inactivation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential failure of other coating technologies amine and ammonium-based polymers to inactivate the virus](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5511.md)
