# __Integration of temperature and humidity data analysis in disease transmission models and risk assessments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Misunderstanding the impact of temperature on the relationship between ah and rh can lead to misinterpretation of environmental risk factors for disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18718.md)
