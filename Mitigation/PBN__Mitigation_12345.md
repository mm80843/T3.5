# __Use alternative manufacturing technologies, improve design to address fitting and weight problems, and develop secondary disinfection measures for safety goggles.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential hazards posed by fff technology in ppe manufacturing, including lack of head protection, fitting problems, weight problems, reduced disinfection possibility, and other disadvantages.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10435.md)
