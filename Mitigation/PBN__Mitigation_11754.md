# __Implementing controlled ventilation strategies to minimize the impact of rapid tracer decay, such as adjusting window opening size and duration.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Rapid tracer decay or ’whoosh’ observed after opening a window, leading to a short-lived, significant dilution of existing tracer gas in the immediate air volume.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9847.md)
