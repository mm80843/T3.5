# __Develop algorithms and protocols for accurate interpretation of wearable data to minimize false positives and improve diagnostic accuracy.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Personal hygiene eg handwashing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_43.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [False-positive results from wearables create risks and require greater effort for correct interpretation of the data.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6753.md)
