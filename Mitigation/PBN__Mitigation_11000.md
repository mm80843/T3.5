# __Implement targeted ventilation and air disinfection strategies at all sampling sites, and enforce strict infection control measures__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Detection of sars-cov-2 aerosol at all sampling sites, including near air outlets and in patientsâ€™ rooms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9102.md)
