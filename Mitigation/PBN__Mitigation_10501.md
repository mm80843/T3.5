# __Use of measures such as the urbanity index to differentiate habitat requirements for different species and the design of heterogeneous networks of green spaces.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inclusion of measures that assess qualitative aspects of community composition is important to distinguish between urban exploiters, alien and invasive species, and native and sensitive species in green spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8608.md)
