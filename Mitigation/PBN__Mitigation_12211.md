# __Integrate biophilic design with advanced air filtration systems and ventilation strategies to mitigate disease transmission risks.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to consider the impact of biophilic design on airborne disease transmission and contagion within the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10303.md)
