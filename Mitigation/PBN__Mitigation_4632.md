## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Agent dimensions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3416.md)
* [Pedestrian trajectories](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3417.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Occupant exposure is accounted for when people are within a social distance radius. The center of the radius can be defined by the nose, center, or shoulder of the modelled pedestrian. Trajectories of pedestrians are used to evaluate if they are within the given radius of interaction.
