# __Conducting temperature-based survival studies and data analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Need for a study on the decay and detectability of sars-cov-2 as a function of temperature.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9429.md)
