# __Regularly monitor and calibrate uvgi systems to ensure that the computed average irradiation flux aligns with the desired survival fraction of microbes. consider implementing real-time monitoring and feedback control systems for uvgi exposure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Incorrect computation of average irradiation flux may result in insufficient uvgi exposure to achieve the desired survival fraction of microbes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5443.md)
