# __Implementation of effective water management strategies, adoption of mosquito control measures, and community-based vector control programs.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of appropriate water management in biophilic design could lead to the proliferation of disease-carrying vectors such as mosquitoes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10339.md)
