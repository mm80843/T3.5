# __Regular testing and monitoring of toilet surfaces and patient stool samples, implementation of strict hygiene protocols, and isolation of affected individuals.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Detection of positive samples in the toilet area and potential presence of sars-cov-2 in patient stool samples present an increased risk of viral spread in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7892.md)
