# __Optimizing ventilation systems to counteract the dispersion caused by people movement and implementing strict ventilation control measures during infectious disease outbreaks.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dispersion of infected aerosol caused by people movement delays the effectiveness of ventilation in controlling contagious diseases in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6151.md)
