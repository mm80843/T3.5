# __Upgrade electrical systems, improve hot water supply, enhance insulation in the building envelope, and implement energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Greywater management](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_11.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Low scores in electricity, domestic hot water, and dynamic envelope domains may lead to compromised living conditions, increasing the risk of illness and disease.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16704.md)
