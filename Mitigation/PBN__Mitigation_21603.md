# __Use alternative methods to set up pcr conditions and implement strict clean room protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unamplified synthetic dna used to set up pcr conditions may introduce contamination during subsequent experiments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19625.md)
