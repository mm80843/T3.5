# __Increase the ventilation rate to achieve the targeted infection probability goal of 2%__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation rate leading to high infection risk](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13688.md)
