# __Conduct specific studies to evaluate the effectiveness of uv-c inactivating sars-cov-2 and implement alternative control measures where effectiveness is uncertain.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of data on the effectiveness of uv-c inactivating sars-cov-2, which may lead to uncertainty in the selection of appropriate control measures for the virus.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17838.md)
