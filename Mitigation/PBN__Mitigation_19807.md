# __Implement sensors and monitoring systems to continuously assess and adjust natural ventilation effectiveness based on current outdoor conditions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on natural ventilation methods may result in inconsistent and unreliable outdoor air flow rates, leading to varying levels of ventilation effectiveness.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17846.md)
