# __Improving ventilation systems, reducing occupancy density, and implementing social distancing measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spread of covid-19 in indoor spaces with high occupancy density and inadequate ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6087.md)
