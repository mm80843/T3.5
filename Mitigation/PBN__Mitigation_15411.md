# __Implement targeted vector control measures based on movement patterns. conduct surveillance and monitoring of infection movements in high-risk areas to detect and respond to outbreaks quickly.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spatial heterogeneities in movement patterns and predicted malaria risk lead to variations in relative rates of infection movements, contributing to malaria spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13487.md)
