# __Develop integrated risk assessments to examine all three routes of transmission and implement engineering controls and environmental management practices to reduce exposure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Few risk calculators account for all three routes of transmission: fomite, airborne, and droplets, potentially underestimating the virus exposure dose for occupants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10465.md)
