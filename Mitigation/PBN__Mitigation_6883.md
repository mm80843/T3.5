# __Implementation of dispersion techniques to prevent agglomeration and maintain the effectiveness of graphene materials.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Selection of materials](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_15.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Agglomeration causing weakened dispersibility and adsorption capacity of graphene, reducing efficacy against microorganisms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5010.md)
