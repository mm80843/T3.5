# __Develop modular digital twin frameworks that can be customized for different clinic sizes, invest in automation for digital twin creation, and use data-driven algorithms to optimize configuration based on clinic size and properties.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Implementing a digital twin for each specific clinic due to non-linear relationships between clinic size and configuration may result in increased resource and time investment for implementation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16374.md)
