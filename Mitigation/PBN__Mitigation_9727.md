# __Focus on increasing outside air fraction along with airflow rates, and utilize air purification technologies to reduce the transmission potential of indoor air__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High airflow rates without increased outside air fraction can increase transmission potential of contagious diseases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7844.md)
