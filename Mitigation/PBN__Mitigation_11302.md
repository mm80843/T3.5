# __Implementation of leak detection technology, regular inspection and maintenance of the collection system to identify and repair leaks and infiltration points.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [No incorporation of leakage or infiltration in the hydraulic model could underestimate the potential for pathogen transport and spread in the collection system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9401.md)
