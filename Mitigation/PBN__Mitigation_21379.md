# __Conduct thorough validation and verification of simulated behaviors with real-world data, involve experts in human behavior and building design in the simulation process.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Embedding contextual information in 3d building models may lead to inaccurate simulation of occupant behaviors and interactions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19401.md)
