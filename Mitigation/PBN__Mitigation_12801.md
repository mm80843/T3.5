# __Use integrated vector management strategies that involve a combination of methods to reduce reliance on chemical-based tools, conduct environmental impact assessments, and implement targeted application techniques.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of chemical-based vector control tools may lead to environmental contamination and harm non-target species.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10890.md)
