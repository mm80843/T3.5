## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Implementation of any combination of control measures, including the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, public gathering ban, transport suspension, and information dissemination, before any COVID-19 cases were discovered, resulting in fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of outbreaks
