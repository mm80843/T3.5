# __Conducting multiple simulation runs to minimize the effects of randomness__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Concerns about the level of randomness in human behaviors in the simulation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19421.md)
