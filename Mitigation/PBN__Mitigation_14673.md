# __Implement ventilation systems, consider air purifiers, and optimize airflow patterns using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate airflow circulation in the closed environment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12754.md)
