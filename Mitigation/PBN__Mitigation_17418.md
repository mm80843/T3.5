# __Utilizing microscopic crowd models for simulating disease spread within confined spaces__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to assess the impact of disease spread in confined spaces without microscopic crowd models](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15479.md)
