# __Increased testing of individual stool specimens and improvements in testing algorithms to accurately estimate viral titer per positive stool.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertainty in viral titer estimates from wastewater could lead to inaccurate calculations of disease prevalence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10748.md)
