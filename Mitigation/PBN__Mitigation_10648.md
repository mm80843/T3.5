# __Regular update of estimates based on new data, improvement of parameter estimation methods, and validation against empirical evidence.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on semi-mechanistic approach with parameters estimated empirically and with strong prior distributions or fixed assumptions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8755.md)
