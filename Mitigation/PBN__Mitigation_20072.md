# __Use combination design of uvgi systems with high-efficiency filtration for more effective removal of biological agents.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spores being resistant to uvgi can lead to ineffective removal of biological agents.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18108.md)
