# __Install air quality monitoring systems and adjust ventilation rates based on occupancy and activity levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Decreased ventilation rates in office rooms to provide ventilation to central meeting rooms may result in poor indoor air quality and increased risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15335.md)
