# __Include the sink effect term in the mass balance equation and implement continuous monitoring of contaminant levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Neglecting the sink effect term in the mass balance equation may result in underestimation of contaminant levels, leading to inadequate mitigation measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12169.md)
