# __Incorporation of detailed regional data and context-specific factors into the modeling framework to capture the heterogeneity of covid-19 transmission dynamics across different spatial locations.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Prevent fake news](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_36.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inference on model parameters for spatial locations based on covid-19 transmission dynamics may lead to biased or oversimplified conclusions about disease transmission in different geographical areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16611.md)
