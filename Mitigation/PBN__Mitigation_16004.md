# __Implement comprehensive traffic flow and circulation planning, considering the impact on air quality and contagion transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Right-angle parking configuration may lead to inefficient circulation and traffic flow within the adapted spaces, increasing congestion and reducing air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14076.md)
