# __Utilize microscopic crowd models coupled with exposed to consider individual attributes and vulnerability factors__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for individual attributes in crowd models can result in higher exposure of vulnerable individuals](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15454.md)
