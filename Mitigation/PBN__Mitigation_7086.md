# __Use of more sensitive biosensor devices with lower lods and development of effective clean-up methods for wastewater samples.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High lods for lassa fever, west nile fever, and influenza could lead to missed detection of the viruses in wastewater, increasing the risk of environmental contamination.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5213.md)
