# __Account for the role of temperature in the degradation of biomarkers in wastewater and adjust monitoring results accordingly to obtain robust data for informing public health response.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Neglecting the impact of temperature on degradation of biomarkers in wastewater can lead to error propagation into estimates of upstream discharge, consumption, exposure, and excretion.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9410.md)
