# __Utilize a combination of gene-specific and comprehensive viral detection methods to ensure accurate surveillance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on pcr assays targeting specific genes for sars-cov-2 detection in wastewater may result in limited virus detection and surveillance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11798.md)
