# __Implementation of automated contact tracing solutions using bluetooth low energy ble and wearable devices to improve accuracy and coverage of close contact identification.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Manual contact tracing is ineffective in identifying all possible close contacts, hindering the effectiveness of contact tracing.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14176.md)
