# __Use additional data sources and verification methods to cross-validate estimated transmission rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assuming a time-dependent function for the wiener process may lead to inaccurate estimation of the transmission rate.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7319.md)
