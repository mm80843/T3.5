# __Stringent quality control and adherence to health and safety regulations during modular construction projects.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased use of modular construction techniques leading to potential gaps and spaces for disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10137.md)
