# __Implement calibration methods to account for temperature variations, conduct further research on temperature influence on viral persistence__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential bias in wastewater temperature as a source of data bias in wastewater-based epidemiology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9397.md)
