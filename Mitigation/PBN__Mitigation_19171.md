# __Investment in domestic resilience, backup supply chains, and shock-resistant infrastructure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Domestic shocks account for about half of the variation in real gdp due to shocks, illustrating that domestic shocks may be at least as important as a source of instability as foreign shocks.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17216.md)
