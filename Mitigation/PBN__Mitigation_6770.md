# __Maintain indoor humidity levels between 40% and 60% as recommended by ashrae.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Human mucus barrier weakens with low humidity levels.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4896.md)
* [Low humidity levels allow droplets to become droplet nuclei, remain in the air for prolonged periods of time, and travel for long distances.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4897.md)
* [Viruses and bacteria thrive on dry conditions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4898.md)
