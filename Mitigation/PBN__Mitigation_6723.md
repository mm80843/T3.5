# __Installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, and integrating air quality monitoring systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation and air quality leading to the accumulation of airborne contaminants and pathogens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4849.md)
