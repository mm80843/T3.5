# __Optimize the model to balance performance and resource requirements, and evaluate trade-offs between parameter count and real-time performance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Selection of a backbone architecture with a higher number of parameters may lead to increased complexity and resource requirements.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15770.md)
