# __Conduct thorough testing and validation of ai models using diverse datasets that represent a wide range of possible contingencies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ai systems assuming all contingencies are the same as those in the training dataset, leading to inaccurate decision-making](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6698.md)
