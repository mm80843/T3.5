# __Application of engineering techniques combined with public health interventions for more effective disease control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Public health interventions may not be sufficient to stop disease outbreaks in modern society, according to mathematical models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5699.md)
