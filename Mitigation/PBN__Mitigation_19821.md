# __Conducting rigorous studies to confirm the pathways of infection and transmission. emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene and surface disinfection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Personal hygiene eg handwashing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_43.md)
