# __Use of effective face coverings and masks, proper fit and usage, and adherence to guidelines on emission control during expiratory activities.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Ensure use of personal protection equipment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_23.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ineffective face coverings and masks may lead to high outward particle emission rates during speaking and coughing, increasing the risk of virus-laden aerosols and droplets transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6131.md)
