# __Research and development of generalized models that can be adapted to different vector-borne diseases and mosquito species.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The modified ross-macdonald model reflects the specific case of zika virus in aedes aegypti mosquitos.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15437.md)
