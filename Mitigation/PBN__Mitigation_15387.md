# __Collect updated pre-control era prevalence data and consider recent population dynamics to define receptivity to imported cases.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of information on receptivity to imported cases due to outdated prevalence data and changes in population dynamics.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13463.md)
