* [Airborne transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_252.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Filters](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_192.md)
* [Or other disinfection technologies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3210.md)
* [Uv](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3209.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Room air cleaners remove airborne pathogens through filters or other disinfection technologies. The clean air delivery rate (CADR) determines the effectiveness of the air cleaner, with higher CADR providing more air changes per hour.
