# __Incorporate comprehensive data on baseline conditions and assess the impact of variability on transmission rate estimates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Differences in epidemic baseline conditions, such as the number of exposed and infectious cases, can impact the accuracy of transmission rate estimates and disease spread modeling.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7331.md)
