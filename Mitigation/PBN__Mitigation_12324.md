# __Thorough testing and quality assurance of components, collaboration with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance, and continuous monitoring and maintenance of makeshift ventilator systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Development of makeshift ventilation solutions using off-the-shelf components and 3d printing techniques may pose risks related to device safety, reliability, and function.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10414.md)
