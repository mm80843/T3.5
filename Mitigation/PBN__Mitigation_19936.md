# __Incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques and data enhancement strategies to address inherent uncertainties.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Systematic errors bias in the modelâ€™s results due to inherent uncertainties and limitations in data inputs.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17974.md)
