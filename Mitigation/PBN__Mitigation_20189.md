# __Implementation of engineering controls such as ventilation systems and air filtration, and adherence to recommended design strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of implementation of engineering controls may lead to increased spread of infection in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18223.md)
