# __Balancing energy efficiency with thermal comfort through advanced control systems and feedback from building occupants. regular temperature monitoring and adjustments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Changes in control of distribution pumps and heat generators for energy efficiency may affect the thermal comfort of building occupants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16658.md)
