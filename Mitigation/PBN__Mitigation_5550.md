# __Continued research on effective recovery methods and development of standardized protocols for virus concentration and detection in wastewater.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of effective methods for the recovery of sars-cov-2 from wastewater increases the risk of inaccurate data and underestimation of virus presence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3677.md)
