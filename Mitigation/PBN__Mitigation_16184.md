# __Develop advanced wastewater treatment processes specifically designed to remove antiviral drugs and their metabolites from wastewater, and increase monitoring and research on their environmental impact.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Presence of antiviral drugs and their metabolized forms in wastewater streams contribute to environmental contamination and potential long-term impacts on microbial resistance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14255.md)
