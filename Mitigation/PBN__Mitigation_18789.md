# __Expand the spatial coverage of ground stations or supplement with additional monitoring tools. utilize spatial interpolation techniques to estimate pollution levels in uncovered areas.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uneven spatial coverage and limited spatial coverage of traditional ground stations may lead to incomplete representation of pollution levels experienced by populations in their proximity.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16842.md)
