## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Non-contact interaction activities hinder the transmission of contagious diseases by eliminating face-to-face contact and maintaining spatial distance between individuals. It allows for convenient and safe access to community services and promotes the development of virtual community spaces. It changes residents' habits and needs, leading to the reconfiguration and optimization of community service facilities.
