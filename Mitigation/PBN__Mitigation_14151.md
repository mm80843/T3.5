# __Use reliable calculation methods and consider energy-efficient uv tube models.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate calculation of required power input for uv tubes leading to underperformance or excessive energy consumption.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12235.md)
