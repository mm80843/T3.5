# __Utilizing advanced statistical techniques to account for non-random allocation and state-dependent impact of npis__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Difficulty in disentangling the impact of individual npis due to non-random allocation and dependency on the state of the epidemic](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7283.md)
