# __Implement better hot water storage systems and flexible infrastructure design.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Low flexibility and storage in hospitals due to domestic hot water, needing more focus.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16641.md)
