# __Proper design analysis of uv-c system for optimal radiation distribution, use of computational fluid dynamics cfd for airflow analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poorly designed uv-c system leading to uneven radiation distribution and ineffective disinfection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12256.md)
