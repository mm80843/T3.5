# __Establish a comprehensive maintenance protocol including regular filter replacement, airflow monitoring, and sealing inspections. utilize advanced filtration monitoring systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ineffective operation and maintenance of hepa filtration systems leading to reduced efficiency in particle removal and air purification.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10497.md)
