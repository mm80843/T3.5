# __Careful validation and testing of the data augmentation techniques, label smoothing, and regularisation methods to ensure they do not introduce bias__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of mosaic data augmentation, class label smoothing, and dropblock regularisation in the input part of the detection module](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15755.md)
