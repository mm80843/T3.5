# __Conduct detailed energy audits, collect and analyze data on energy use before and during the pandemic, and develop adaptive energy management strategies based on data-driven insights.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of quantitative data reported on the impacts of covid-19 on energy use of lighting and hvac loads in individual buildings, leading to uncertainty and potential inefficiencies in energy management strategies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20382.md)
