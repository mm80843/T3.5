# __Implement standardized training and guidelines for quality assessments to ensure consistent identification and mitigation of disease transmission risks.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assessments of quality were initially made by one reviewer and then cross-checked by another, potentially leading to discrepancies in identifying risks of disease transmission in the study environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12902.md)
