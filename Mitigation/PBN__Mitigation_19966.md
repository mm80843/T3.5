# __Conduct thorough indoor air quality assessments and ventilation system evaluations to ensure that changes in occupant distribution do not compromise indoor air quality. implement measures to ensure adequate ventilation and air purification.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The optimization of occupant distribution patterns to minimize covid-19 infections could lead to unintended consequences such as reduced indoor air quality or increased transmission risk in certain areas of the building.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18004.md)
