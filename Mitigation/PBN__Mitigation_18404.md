# __Implementing engineering controls such as improved ventilation, air filtration, and spatial design to limit the spread of airborne pathogens__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Vulnerabilities in building design and infrastructure that allow for the spread of contagious diseases like covid-19](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16461.md)
