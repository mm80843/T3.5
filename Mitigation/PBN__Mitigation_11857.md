# __Use multiple sources of data to estimate initial infections and consider a range of case detection rates for more accurate projections.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Seed each simulation by adjusting observed i t on the first day using country-specific estimates of case detection rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9950.md)
