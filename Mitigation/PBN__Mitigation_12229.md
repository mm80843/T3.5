# __Integrate air purification systems and ventilation design to ensure high indoor air quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for air quality in biophilic design may lead to the spread of airborne diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10321.md)
