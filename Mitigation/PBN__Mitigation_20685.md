# __Conduct research to understand the impact of humidity on droplet and aerosol transmission of influenza__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relationship between rh and transmission via droplets and aerosols, where rh affects their physics and chemistry](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18715.md)
