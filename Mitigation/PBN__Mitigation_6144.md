# __Implementation of mechanical ventilation systems to ensure efficient air circulation and filtration__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation due to uncomplimentary climatic circumstances, limiting the ability to keep windows and doors open](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4273.md)
