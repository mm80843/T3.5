# __Regular software updates and validation against real-time data, investment in modern modeling and simulation software.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of outdated or inaccurate modeling software for hydraulic modeling could lead to errors in the representation of wastewater flow rates and travel times.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9402.md)
