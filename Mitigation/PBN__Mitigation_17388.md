# __Refine and validate the simulation algorithms to accurately represent agent interactions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate simulation of agent interactions may lead to underestimation of occupant exposure in confined spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15449.md)
