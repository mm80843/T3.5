# __Implement a system to track badge usage and monitor patient interactions, deploy contact tracing technology to identify potential exposure, establish clear protocols for isolation and testing of individuals in contact with badges.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of visibility into the number of patients and their contact with the badges increases the difficulty of contact tracing and containment of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16389.md)
