# __Provide clear documentation and explanation of the modeling approach, conduct sensitivity analyses, and involve domain experts in the interpretation of results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of dynamic modeling and population-based kalman filter approach introduces a risk of model complexity and interpretation challenges.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7290.md)
