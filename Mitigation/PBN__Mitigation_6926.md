# __Conducting rigorous testing and validation of new nanomaterial-based disinfection systems to ensure their effectiveness and safety.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on new nanomaterials and disinfection systems with self-reactivation mechanisms may create a false sense of security and lead to inadequate disinfection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5053.md)
