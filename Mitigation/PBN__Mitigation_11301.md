# __Regular validation and update of wastewater loading and population density data, considering factors such as demographic changes and industrial activity.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Estimation of wastewater loading and population density could result in inaccurate representation of actual wastewater flows and population exposure to contaminants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9400.md)
