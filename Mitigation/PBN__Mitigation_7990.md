# __Improving experimental methods, such as using advanced high-speed photography and particle detection techniques, to capture a wider range of droplet sizes and trajectories.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of sensitivity in experimental methods for capturing all droplets emitted during coughing and sneezing may lead to incomplete understanding of droplet propagation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6118.md)
