# __Implement energy-efficient hvac systems and building design to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high air exchange rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased air exchange rate may lead to higher energy consumption in the building.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17960.md)
