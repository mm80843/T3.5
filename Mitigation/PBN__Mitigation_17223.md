# __Routine battery health checks, backup power sources, and automated alerts for low battery levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Designing separate battery units for the sensor network introduces the risk of battery failure and data loss if not monitored effectively.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15283.md)
