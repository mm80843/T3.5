# __Improvements in testing algorithms to detect asymptomatic cases and expanded use of wastewater-based surveillance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [A significant fraction of cases may go undetected with current testing algorithms, especially asymptomatic individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10750.md)
