# __Thorough understanding of camera intrinsic matrix, rotation matrix, and translation matrix, rigorous testing and validation of transformation algorithms__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of understanding of the geometric transformation and mapping in the context of computer vision](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15750.md)
