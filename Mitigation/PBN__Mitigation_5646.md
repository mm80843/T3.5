# __Encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances or implement cooling systems to offset the heat generated.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Frequent use of electric appliances leads to increased internal heat gain, potentially contributing to the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3773.md)
