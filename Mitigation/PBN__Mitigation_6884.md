# __Ensure proper dispersion of nanomaterials and regular testing for antimicrobial effectiveness__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Improper dispersion of nanomaterials like graphene and mnps may lead to reduced antimicrobial activity, allowing pathogens to spread](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5011.md)
