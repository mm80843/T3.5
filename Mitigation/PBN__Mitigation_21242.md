# __Implement measures to reduce the risk of transmission on trains and in areas with high population flow.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The spread of covid-19 is associated with the number of trains, population flow, and percentage of the aging population.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19266.md)
