# __Implement automatic ventilation systems and ieq monitoring systems to maintain acceptable indoor environmental quality ieq parameters.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in public buildings in winter leading to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of covid-19 transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6240.md)
