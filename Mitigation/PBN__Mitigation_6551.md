# __Considering time constraints when bidding for new projects, addressing bid strategies specifically for each project, implementing safety changes on construction sites.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Longer project completion times due to safety changes, reduced on-site workforce, and time constraints for new construction projects.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4678.md)
