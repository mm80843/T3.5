# __Implementation of flexible and adaptable designs that can quickly react to new challenges, including the coronavirus epidemic__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Rapid spread of contagious diseases, including the coronavirus, due to inadequate design adaptation to new challenges](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4275.md)
