# __Consider using other sampling methods in conjunction with stratified random sampling to ensure a more comprehensive representation of the population.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Stratified random sampling approach may not fully represent the diversity of the population, leading to biased results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14484.md)
