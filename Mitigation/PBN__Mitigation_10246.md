# __Incorporate energy recovery ventilation erv systems and adjust ventilation rates based on infection probability and exposure time__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation leading to poor indoor air quality iaq](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8356.md)
