# __Conduct rigorous external validation using diverse and independent datasets to assess the generalizability and reliability of the anomaly detection models.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited external validation of anomaly detection models may result in overfitting to specific datasets, reducing the modelsâ€™ generalizability and reliability.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6921.md)
