# __Integrate building envelope design strategies that prioritize thermal comfort, natural ventilation, and effective heat exchange to mitigate temperature extremes and maintain indoor air quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Adapting the building envelope for heat exchange control and ventilation in educational spaces may face challenges in maintaining a comfortable indoor environment, especially in extreme climate zones.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14071.md)
