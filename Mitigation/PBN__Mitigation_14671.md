# __Regular airflow testing and adjustment of fan and air-conditioner positions to ensure even air distribution.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Imbalanced air distribution due to the positioning of fans and air-conditioners leading to stagnant air pockets.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12752.md)
