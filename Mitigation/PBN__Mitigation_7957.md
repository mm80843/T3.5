# __Conducting studies to understand droplet and aerosol trajectory under various conditions and developing guidance for ventilation strategies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertainty in the trajectory of droplets and aerosols containing viral particles under different environmental conditions and ventilation modes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6085.md)
