# __Weather normalization of loads analysis is essential for a complete picture of load behavior and accurate energy consumption evaluation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Non-weather normalized loads analysis increases the risk of incomplete understanding of load behavior across a day-long period, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20357.md)
