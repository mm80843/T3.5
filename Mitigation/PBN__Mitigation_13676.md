# __Train ai algorithms with diverse and representative datasets from different populations to improve generalizability of predictions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ai predictive models trained on chinese samples may not be generalizable to other populations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11764.md)
