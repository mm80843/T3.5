# __Proper calibration of ventilation rate and ventilation system to ensure adequate exposure to uv-c irradiation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Incorrect implementation of combination of general ventilation system and uv lamps](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18104.md)
