# __Open-sourcing the model code, fostering collaboration with experts from diverse programming backgrounds, continuous peer review and validation of the model code.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on a specific programming language and package for the agent-based model may limit accessibility and collaboration, leading to a lack of diverse perspectives and expertise in the development and validation process.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14352.md)
