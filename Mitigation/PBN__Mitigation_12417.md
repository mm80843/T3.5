# __Further investigation of displacement ventilationâ€™s efficacy in integrated outcomes and potential cost-saving measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Displacement ventilation promotes vertical stratification and higher ventilation effectiveness but may have mixed cost-effectiveness.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10506.md)
