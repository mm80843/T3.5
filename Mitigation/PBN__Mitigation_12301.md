# __Consult public health experts and epidemiologists in the design process to incorporate measures that minimize disease transmission__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate consideration of disease transmission in natural design elements could pose a risk to public health in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10393.md)
