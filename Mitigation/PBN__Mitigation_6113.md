# __Regular maintenance and inspection of air filtration systems, use of high-quality filter materials, and sealing gaps for better air filtration.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Gaps in filter edges contributing to system failures in removing pathogens from shared air environments, impacting transmission of infections.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4242.md)
