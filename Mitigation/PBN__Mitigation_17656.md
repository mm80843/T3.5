# __Integration of health risk assessment algorithms into the classification system, comprehensive data analysis from multiple viewpoints, and regular evaluation of disease transmission patterns__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Risks associated with viewpoint-independent human classification algorithm that may lead to overlooking potential health risks and disease transmission patterns](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15716.md)
