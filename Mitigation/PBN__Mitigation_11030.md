# __Engage in an integrated design process to consider appropriate infection control strategies early in the building design, especially for buildings with a higher risk of transmission, and implement ashrae guidelines__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate consideration of infection control strategies in the early stages of building design](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9131.md)
