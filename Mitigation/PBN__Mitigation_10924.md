# __Adjust energy contracts based on actual building usage and implement energy-saving measures__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unoccupied building leading to higher energy demand than necessary](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9027.md)
