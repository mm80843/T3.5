# __Optimize airflow rates to prioritize fresh air intake and reduce recirculation, upgrade ventilation systems to improve air exchange rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased airflow rates that primarily improve recirculated indoor air delivery may raise transmission possibilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4301.md)
