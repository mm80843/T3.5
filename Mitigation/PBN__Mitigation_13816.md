# __Plan and coordinate construction activities to minimize disruption, and implement environmental impact assessments for new facility construction.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Separate water facilities toilets/bathrooms for contaminated](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_46.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The spatial configuration requirements for new facilities in the community life circles may lead to increased construction activity and potential disruption to existing infrastructure.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11903.md)
