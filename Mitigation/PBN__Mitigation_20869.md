# __Development of lightweight security solutions, energy-efficient encryption algorithms, and stringent privacy protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Privacy and security risks due to constraints of iot devices, such as low power and computational speed, and the need for energy-efficient security algorithms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18897.md)
