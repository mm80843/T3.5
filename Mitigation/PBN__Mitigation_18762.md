# __Adopt adaptive temperature control strategies based on occupant preferences and behavior, and align indoor temperature setpoints with international thermal comfort standards.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Narrow control clauses in commercial office tenancy agreements may lead to suboptimal indoor temperature management, potentially impacting occupant comfort and energy efficiency.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16815.md)
