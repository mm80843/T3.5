# __Research on sustainable engineering design principles, collaboration with environmental and sustainability experts__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate focus on efficient and sustainable health engineering design systems may lead to the implementation of suboptimal building design strategies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4333.md)
