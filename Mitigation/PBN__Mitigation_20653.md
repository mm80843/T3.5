# __Implement measures to reduce the survival of aerosolized viruses, such as increasing ventilation and air circulation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient time for environmental conditions to affect the viability of viruses in released aerosols](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18683.md)
