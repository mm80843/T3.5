# __Implementing higher rates of outdoor air supply and air exchange to reduce the concentration of potentially infectious airborne particles.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ventilation systems that recirculate a proportion of indoor air can contribute to the spread of contagious diseases if not properly regulated.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6184.md)
