# __Investment in affordable virtual reality devices, improvement of supporting infrastructure, and development of alternative virtual reality technologies that require lower computing power.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of access to virtual reality technology in low-income countries due to high cost and computing power requirement.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18467.md)
