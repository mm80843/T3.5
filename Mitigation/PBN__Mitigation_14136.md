# __Conduct research to characterize the effect of rh on uv inactivation rate and develop models or guidelines for uv disinfection under different rh conditions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertain relationship between relative humidity rh and uv inactivation rate of bacterial aerosols.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12220.md)
