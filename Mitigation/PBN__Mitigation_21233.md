# __Implement strict control measures in areas with high positive coefficients of population flow__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Positive coefficients of population flow correlated with higher infection ratios](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19257.md)
