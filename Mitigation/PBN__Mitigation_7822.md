# __Implement strategies to address the uneven distribution of children’s activity hubs and promote consistent distribution for disease spread prevention.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of effect on children’s r0 due to the breakup of activity hubs, potentially leading to targeted spread of contagious diseases among children.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5952.md)
