# __Promote good room air mixing and ensure that larger aerosol particles receive the required uv irradiation dose__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate uv irradiation of larger aerosol particles](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5473.md)
