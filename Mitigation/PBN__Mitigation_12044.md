# __Implementing advanced ventilation systems and energy-efficient technologies to improve indoor air quality and reduce energy consumption.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Underutilization of offices and commercial spaces during lockdown leading to ventilation issues and increased energy consumption.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10136.md)
