# __Development of cost-effective, non-invasive ieq monitoring tools with wider spatial coverage and remote data storage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Traditional ieq monitoring protocol involving high-cost, invasive environmental sensors with limited spatial dimension and data storage.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8912.md)
