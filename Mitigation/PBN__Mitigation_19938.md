# __Implement stricter occupancy limits, enhance ventilation and air filtration systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Exponential relationship between quanta concentration and time, leading to higher virus particles with increased occupant density.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17976.md)
