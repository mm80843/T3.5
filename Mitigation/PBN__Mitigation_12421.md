# __Increase ventilation rates and adopt technologies to improve air quality , hepa filters, uv-c air purifiers__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
