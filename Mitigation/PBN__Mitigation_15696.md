# __Regular assessment of algorithm biases, diversification of training data, and transparency in ai decision-making processes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Deployment of ai and ml for disease prediction and diagnosis may lead to biases in decision-making and inaccurate assessments, impacting treatment and resource allocation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13771.md)
