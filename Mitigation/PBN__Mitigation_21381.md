# __Implement data-driven approach for behavior modeling, automate behavior parameter adjustment based on real occupancy data, optimize user interface and system performance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Difficulty in manually adjusting behavior-generating parameters for simulations with many occupants may lead to inefficiency and potential errors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19403.md)
