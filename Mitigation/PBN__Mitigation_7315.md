# __Carefully validate and calibrate the z value adjustments for upper-room uvgi systems based on experimental data and conditions specific to the room.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate adjustment of z values for use with upper-room uvgi systems may lead to ineffective disinfection of microbes suspended in the air.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5442.md)
