# __Develop a dynamic design platform that incorporates real-time data and adaptable algorithms to respond to changing sops and public health guidelines. implement feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement and adaptation to new information.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on static design solutions that may not adapt to changing sops and public health guidelines related to covid-19.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12799.md)
