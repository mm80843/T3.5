# __Validation of laboratory simulations through real-world data and historical disease spread patterns to improve the accuracy of the models.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Laboratory simulations of aerosol dispersion in a fluid-filled channel may assist in modeling contagious disease spread in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6150.md)
