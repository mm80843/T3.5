# __Conduct studies to understand the impact of viral clumping and protein associations on uv-c disinfection effectiveness.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Viral clumping and associations with suspended proteins may cause variability in viral particle size.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12194.md)
