# __Operate hvac systems for extended periods, utilize ventilation at nominal speed, and implement demand-controlled ventilation systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate operation of hvac systems leading to poor ventilation and increased risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8326.md)
