## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Air conditioning](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3049.md)
* [Housing quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3048.md)
* [Insecticide-treated screens](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3047.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Good quality housing and air conditioning can reduce exposure to mosquitoes and protect against arboviral infections. Insecticide-treated screens can also help reduce infection rates.
