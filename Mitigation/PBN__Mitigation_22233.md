# __Adopt strict laboratory protocols for sample handling and processing to minimize the risk of contamination. use negative controls and blank samples to monitor for contamination. perform bioinformatic analysis to identify and remove potential contaminants from the dataset.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential contamination of sequencing data by environmental dna or other contaminants during sample preparation and processing.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20254.md)
