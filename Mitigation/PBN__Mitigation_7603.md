# __Implement additional measures such as physical distancing, masking, and hand hygiene to complement ventilation strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The proximity of people in densely occupied spaces increases the risk of disease transmission by contact and droplet transmission despite the use of dilution ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5730.md)
