# __Implement automated control systems for thermal exchanges, and integrate fault-detection and diagnostics platform for hvac systems to ensure optimal indoor air quality and temperature regulation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of control over thermal exchanges and absence of fault-detection and diagnostics platform pose risks for maintaining indoor air quality and temperature regulation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16733.md)
