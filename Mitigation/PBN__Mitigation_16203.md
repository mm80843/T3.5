# __Improved surveillance techniques and data analysis to account for transient population in catchment areas__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertainty in population size making it challenging to monitor the emergence of infections within a community from wastewater](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14274.md)
