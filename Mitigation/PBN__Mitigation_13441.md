## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited scope of data collection within the u.s. and lack of data from other countries may limit the robustness of the three-cluster solution.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11529.md)
