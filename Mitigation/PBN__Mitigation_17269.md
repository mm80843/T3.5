# __Implement night-time ventilation and consider adding a cooling system with local cooling and room temperature control__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High temperatures due to lack of ventilation leading to loss of productivity](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15329.md)
