# __Development of robust dose-response models for sars-cov-2 and improved monitoring of viral shedding in wastewater.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variability in viral shedding from infected persons and uncertainty in viral gene copies detected in human excreta.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11780.md)
