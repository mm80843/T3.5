# __Implement energy-efficient hvac systems, optimize building insulation, and adjust occupancy scheduling__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Low energy consumption patterns leading to specific occupancy levels](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17968.md)
