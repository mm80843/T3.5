## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Insecticides](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3823.md)
* [Spraying equipment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_2316.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

IRS involves the application of residual insecticides to the inner walls of rooms, which are frequented by mosquitoes. The insecticide remains on the walls and surfaces, thereby killing or repelling mosquitoes that come into contact with them. IRS can reduce mosquito populations and prevent them from feeding on humans, reducing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.
