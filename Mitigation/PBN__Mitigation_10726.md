# __Comprehensively test different densities such as normal, lognormal, triangular, uniform, and weibull distributions to identify the most suitable characterization for unobserved factors.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate consideration of heterogeneity parameters and densities in the regression model could lead to inappropriate characterizations of unobserved factors related to contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8831.md)
