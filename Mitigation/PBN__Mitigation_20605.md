# __Invest in research and development for biomarker discovery and extraction technologies, and develop analytical tools for sensitive and selective analysis of covid-19 biomarkers.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Challenges in wbe surveillance of water and wastewater concerning covid-19, including the non-existence of biomarkers discovery pipeline, accounting for population size fluctuations, need for biomarker extraction technology, and lack of analytical tools.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18635.md)
