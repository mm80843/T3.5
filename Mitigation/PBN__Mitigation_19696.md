# __Implementation of guv air disinfection technology to reduce the concentration of airborne pathogens and ensure a safer built environment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of germicidal ultraviolet guv air disinfection leading to unchecked viral spread in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17736.md)
