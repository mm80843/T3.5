# __Ensure proper airflow direction from safe to unsafe areas, and from personal use areas to public areas. utilize technology to monitor and maintain pressure differentials.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate pressure differential leading to potential for cross-contamination of air between safe and unsafe areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8328.md)
