# __Calibrate and validate the sensor data regularly, employ redundancy and data validation techniques to cross-verify sensor readings.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Utilization of low-cost micro gas sensors and arduino microcontroller may result in inaccurate iaq monitoring and data quality issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15290.md)
