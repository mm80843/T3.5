## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inactivation of virus](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3387.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Heat](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_2794.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Pasteurization at 60Â°C for 90 minutes before sample collection inactivates the virus, reducing the risk of transmission during handling and processing.
