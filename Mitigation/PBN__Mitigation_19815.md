# __Ensuring appropriate placement of supply and exhaust vents, and optimizing ventilation system design__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate distribution of ventilation leading to inadequate dilution of contaminated air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17854.md)
