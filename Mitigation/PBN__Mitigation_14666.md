# __Conduct thorough practical significance analysis to identify and incorporate other relevant constraints into the design process.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Stricter social distancing requirements may not be the only constraints to consider in the design of built environments for disease propagation mitigation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12747.md)
