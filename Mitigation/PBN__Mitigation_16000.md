# __Implementing proper ventilation systems and air purification technologies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in enclosed spaces leading to increased risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14072.md)
