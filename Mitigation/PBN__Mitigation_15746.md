# __Exploring space-saving design alternatives for the containment room module, and assessing the feasibility of alternative containment space locations within the home.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Recent homes with double garages at the front may require the owner to forgo a car parking space in order to insert a containment room module.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13821.md)
