# __Increasing ventilation rates, using air purifiers, and promoting outdoor air circulation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Short-range aerosol transmission due to low ventilation rate](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17556.md)
