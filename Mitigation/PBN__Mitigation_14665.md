# __Conduct a comprehensive spatial analysis and consider additional design constraints to more accurately represent the built environment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assuming a given physical space and constraints based on basic mathematical shapes may not accurately reflect the complexities of a built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12746.md)
