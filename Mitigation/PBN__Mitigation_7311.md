# __Implement measures to monitor uv dosage and saturation levels to ensure thorough inactivation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The potential for incomplete viral inactivation due to the saturation of the ’target’ with uv photons](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5438.md)
