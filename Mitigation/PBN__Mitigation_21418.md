# __Provide comprehensive training on interpreting visualization results and offer supplementary data for deeper analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The visualization methods may oversimplify the complexity of virus transmission in the built environment, leading to misinterpretation of simulation results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19440.md)
