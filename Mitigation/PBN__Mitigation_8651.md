# __Overcome obstacles related to accuracy and calibration by improving monitoring technology and developing adaptive algorithms for bp estimation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Obstacles exist in achieving accurate bp estimations, especially when tracking responses to medications, due to the dynamic nature and variability of bp in different individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6777.md)
