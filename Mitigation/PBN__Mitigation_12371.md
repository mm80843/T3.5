# __Improvement of hvac standards, implementation of effective iaq control measures, and increased ventilation rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient hvac standards for diluting indoor air to prevent airborne pathogen transmission in high-occupancy facilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10460.md)
