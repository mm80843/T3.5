# __Implement enhanced ventilation systems, exhaust systems, and natural ventilation to improve indoor air quality and minimize the risk of airborne disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation and airflow control may lead to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13207.md)
