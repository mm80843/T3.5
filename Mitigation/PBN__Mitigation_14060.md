# __Regular monitoring and testing for microbial pollution in the indoor air. use of additional filtration and purification methods to eliminate any potential release of microorganisms.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential spread of indoor microbial pollution due to the use of biofiltration system for degradation of formaldehyde and vocs in the air.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12145.md)
