# __Hyperparameter search techniques such as grid search or random search, and meticulous validation of learning rate schedules to ensure model convergence and performance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Using stochastic gradient descent sgd with warm restarts and a cosine annealing learning rate schedule may lead to challenges in hyperparameter tuning and model convergence, as well as the need for careful adjustment of learning rate values.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15747.md)
