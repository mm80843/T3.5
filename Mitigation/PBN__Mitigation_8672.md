# __Integration of multiple sensors and data validation to improve accuracy of occupancy and density estimation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate estimation of outdoor environment occupancy and density may lead to ineffective crowd management and disease transmission control.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6798.md)
