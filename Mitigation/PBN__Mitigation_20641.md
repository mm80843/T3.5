# __Conduct further research and studies to understand the behavior of droplets containing contagions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Study of droplet physics and chemistry may lead to understanding the behavior of contagions in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18671.md)
