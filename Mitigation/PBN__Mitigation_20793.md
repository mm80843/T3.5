# __Improve the distribution and accessibility of ugss through urban planning and infrastructure development to encourage physical activity.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Heterogeneous distribution of ugss causing large areas to be further than a ten minutes walking distance, making them considered unavailable.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18822.md)
