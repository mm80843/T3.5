# __Conduct uv irradiation experiments on aerosols containing sars-cov-2 virus to determine accurate z ur value__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assumptions made regarding z ur value for upper-room uvgi analysis based on published mean z values for aerosolised coronaviruses](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5457.md)
