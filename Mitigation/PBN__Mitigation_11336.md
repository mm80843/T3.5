# __Development of standardized data formats and interoperable systems, implementation of data integration strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Disintegrated and non-interoperable data inhibits computer-assisted reasoning, hindering artificial intelligence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9435.md)
