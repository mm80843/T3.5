## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Ventilation provides air movement that dilutes and disperses respiratory particles, reducing the concentration of particles in the air

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Airborne transmission of respiratory particles](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3004.md)
