# __Implement high-efficiency air filters and regular maintenance to reduce particulate matter in air supply.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of effective air filtering may result in increased particulate matter in the air supply, potentially worsening indoor air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13204.md)
