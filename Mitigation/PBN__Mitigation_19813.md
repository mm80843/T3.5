# __Implementing enhanced ventilation systems and air filtration, and ensuring appropriate distribution of ventilation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation leading to high concentration of virus-laden air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17852.md)
