# __Combine wearable sensor data with traditional testing methods to ensure accuracy and completeness of data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relying solely on wearable sensors and smart solutions for large-scale detection of cases may result in inaccurate or incomplete data.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14720.md)
