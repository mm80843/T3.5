# __Implement complementary measures such as air filtration, uvgi systems, and ventilation controls to supplement the effectiveness of ventilation in preventing indoor airborne transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ventilation alone cannot prevent indoor airborne transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10514.md)
