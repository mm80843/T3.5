# __Implement integrated approach that combines both drug treatment and vector control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Combining drugs with vector control may be more effective than either approach alone.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10841.md)
