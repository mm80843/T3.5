# __Implementing measures based on simulation outcomes to reduce the risk of virus transmission, such as rearranging spaces, improving ventilation, and hygiene protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Virtual humans with agency behaving realistically within the building model can simulate virus transmission scenarios.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19449.md)
