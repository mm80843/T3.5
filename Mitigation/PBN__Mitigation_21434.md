# __Develop a system that incorporates both macro-level and micro-level interaction simulations, considering individual and group behaviors within the built environment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relying solely on macro-level mobility aspects in the simulation without considering micro-level interactions within environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19456.md)
