# __Implementation of effective ventilation systems to dilute and remove infectious particles in indoor air__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Less transmission by large droplets and surfaces, and more by the airborne route](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17734.md)
