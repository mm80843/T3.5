# __Implement strategies to control and manage invasive species, including removal, habitat restoration, and promoting native plant diversity.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Presence of non-native and invasive plant species negatively affecting avian and lepidopteran communities, potentially leading to population decline and loss of biodiversity.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8581.md)
