# __Identify and implement additional air disinfection and ventilation strategies to achieve higher pathogen reductions, and conduct regular monitoring of pathogen levels to assess effectiveness.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited pathogen reductions through air disinfection measures, such as uv, result in less than 1 log of risk reduction, which may be insufficient for effective control of airborne pathogens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17709.md)
