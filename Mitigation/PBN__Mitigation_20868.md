# __Investment in scalable infrastructure, energy-efficient iot devices, and optimization of data transmission protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Absorb surge in service demande](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_35.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Scalability challenge due to the exponential increase in iot devices in iomt, leading to energy requirements and bandwidth issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18896.md)
