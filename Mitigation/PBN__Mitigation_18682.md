# __Implement automated lighting and dynamic envelope control systems to optimize natural light usage and ventilation, improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of airborne disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on manual control for lighting and dynamic envelope elements may result in suboptimal use of natural light and ventilation, leading to indoor air quality issues and increased risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16735.md)
