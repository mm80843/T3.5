# __Optimize computational processes to reduce the burden on sensing nodes and extend battery life.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to reduce computational burden of sensing nodes may lead to shorter battery life of the monitoring system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15277.md)
