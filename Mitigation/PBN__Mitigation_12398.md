# __Upgrading ventilation systems and fans, using in-duct uvgi as a supplement to other hvac interventions__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited effectiveness of in-duct uvgi systems due to ventilation system efficiency and fan capacity](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10487.md)
