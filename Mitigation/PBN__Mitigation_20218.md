# __Implement enhanced ventilation strategies, consider pressurization, dilution, and air purification__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ventilation in congested indoor spaces can lead to virus-containing particles reaching residents before filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18250.md)
