# __Use of air purifiers, increase in air change rate, and implementation of infection control measures__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for airborne cross-infection due to low air velocity and disturbance of boundary layer around individuals](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5720.md)
