# __Education and awareness-building about the concrete risks associated with nuclear energy, emphasizing the importance of precautionary measures and safety protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High-power representations of nuclear energy result in abstract construal, leading to reduced risk perception and increased optimism, potentially affecting attitudes towards nuclear energy.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19208.md)
