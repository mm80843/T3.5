# __Design and implement a lighting plan that meets the recommended light levels for educational spaces, considering natural lighting, artificial lighting, and energy-efficient fixtures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variation in illumination standards between car parking buildings and educational spaces poses a challenge in providing adequate lighting for the adapted spaces, increasing the risk of discomfort and potential safety hazards.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14070.md)
