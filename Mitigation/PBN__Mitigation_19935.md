# __Include multiple transmission mechanisms in the model to align with real-world infection patterns.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate validation of the mathematical model for estimating the number of infected people due to limited consideration of infection mechanisms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17973.md)
