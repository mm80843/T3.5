# __Enhance surveillance systems for early detection of tropical pathogens, invest in research and development for tropical disease response.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of adequate surveillance systems to cope with the arrival and dispersal of tropical pathogens associated with warmer temperatures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14827.md)
