# __Implementation of recommendations for ventilation systems, particle filtration, and air disinfection to reduce airborne transmission risk.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of recommendations and engineering controls to reduce the potential airborne transmission of sars-cov-2 and other airborne viruses.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17857.md)
