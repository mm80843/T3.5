# __Conduct studies with more wastewater samples over a longer period to understand the stability of pmmov loading for the catchment population.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variations in pmmov concentrations across samples without understanding the stability over time for the catchment population.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10752.md)
