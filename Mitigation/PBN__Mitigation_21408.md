# __Conduct thorough validation of the simulation accuracy using real-world data and expert review. provide transparent documentation of validation process and results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate validation of simulation accuracy may result in unreliable outcomes and recommendations for safe space design and policy-making.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19430.md)
