# __Implement thorough auditing and design evaluation of bacs in smart buildings to ensure optimal control systems and energy performance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of auditing and design evaluation of bacs in smart buildings leading to large energy performance gaps and suboptimal control systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16758.md)
