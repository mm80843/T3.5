# __Install enhanced hvac systems with proper filtration and ventilation or use air purifiers to reduce the risk of disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate natural ventilation in academic buildings a, b, c, and workshop building d increases the risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14081.md)
