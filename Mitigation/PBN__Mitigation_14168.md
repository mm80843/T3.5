# __Regular maintenance, cleaning, and replacement of uv-c lamps. control of air temperature and dust pollution. monitoring and maintenance of reflective surfaces in ventilation ducts.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Decreasing efficiency of uv-c system due to lamp degradation, air temperature, dust pollution, and reflective surface degradation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12252.md)
