# __Implementing regular cleaning and maintenance protocols for the sensing devices to prevent contamination.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dense distribution of sensing devices increases the risk of pathogen spread in case of contamination.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16823.md)
