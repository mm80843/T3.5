# __Implement targeted malaria interventions and vector control measures in areas with high movement rates. provide education and awareness campaigns to promote preventative measures such as bed nets and insect repellent.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
