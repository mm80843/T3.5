# __Creation of designated balcony usage schedules, promotion of staggered balcony usage, and provision of alternative outdoor communal spaces.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of sufficient space on balconies may lead to a higher concentration of people in indoor communal areas, increasing the risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4975.md)
