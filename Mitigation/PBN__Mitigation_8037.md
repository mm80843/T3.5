# __Use direct air flow measurements, monitor co2 levels, and implement ventilation rate monitoring systems__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate measurement of ventilation rates leading to assumption of adequate outdoor air supply](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6165.md)
