# __Implementation of proper ventilation systems and home automation for regular air changes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in living environments leading to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7630.md)
