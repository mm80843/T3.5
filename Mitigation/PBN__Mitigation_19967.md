# __Implement advanced hvac control systems that can optimize energy efficiency while maintaining adequate ventilation rates. conduct regular air quality testing and monitoring to ensure that indoor air quality is not compromised.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on hvac system for energy efficiency and occupant comfort may lead to a trade-off between energy consumption and ventilation rates, potentially compromising indoor air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18005.md)
