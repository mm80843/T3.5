* [Resilient design principles](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3673.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Critical infrastructure should have the ability to withstand any kind of disturbance and not suffer degradation or loss of function. It should be able to perform despite challenges and absorb the impact of disruptive events.
