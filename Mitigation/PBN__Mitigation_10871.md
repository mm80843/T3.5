# __Implement a bidirectional data flow system that enables real-time interaction between building occupants and environmental control systems for responsive and adaptive ieq management.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited data flow and feedback interaction in ibem may hinder real-time adjustment of environmental parameters based on occupantsâ€™ needs and preferences.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8975.md)
