# __Development of extensive clean-up methods to remove matrix interferences prior to biosensor detection and validation of the effectiveness of the clean-up process.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Complex matrix in wastewaters may interfere with biosensor detection, leading to inaccurate results and potential misinterpretation of viral presence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5215.md)
