# __Implementing efficient hvac systems, smart lighting controls, and acoustic treatments to maintain comfort and air quality at all times.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assessment of thermal comfort, lighting, and iaq compliance only during occupied hours 8am -6pm , and acoustic compliance during unoccupied hours 7pm -7am after the air conditioning system has started.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16765.md)
