# __Incorporate error margins and confidence intervals into the analysis, validate absolute counts with other data sources, and consider the limitations of calibration methods.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Conversion of relative estimates into absolute activity numbers may introduce errors due to calibration and sampling limitations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12310.md)
