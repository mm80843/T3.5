# __Regularly adjust uv exposure levels based on mapping data to ensure consistent and effective disinfection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uv radiation mapping shows variability in uv exposure levels across the chamber.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12210.md)
