# __Implement energy-efficient ventilation systems and air filtration technologies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increasing ventilation rate in buildings reduces the number of infected people but increases hvac energy consumption](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17952.md)
