# __Encourage the standardization of health outcome measurements and criteria in research studies to enable meta-analyses in these areas.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to conduct meta-analysis for certain health outcomes such as cancer, respiratory mortality, and neurological outcomes due to lack of comparable results from multiple studies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12889.md)
