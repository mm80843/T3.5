# __Implement air filtration systems and regular cleaning of ventilation systems to reduce the spread of airborne diseases__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ventilation domain scoring high in energy efficiency, maintenance, and comfort, increasing air circulation and potential disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16687.md)
