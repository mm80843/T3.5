# __Careful planning and design of trails to minimize disturbance to forest patches while still allowing for human interaction with nature.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Minimizing forest edges and designing trails far from forest patches may reduce wildlife protection and mental health benefits while allowing human immersion in nature.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8583.md)
