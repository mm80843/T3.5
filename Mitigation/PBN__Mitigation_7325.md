# __Conduct studies that replicate real-world scenarios to accurately assess the effectiveness of uv irradiation on different viruses.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Studies on the susceptibility of different viruses to uv irradiation could lead to the underestimation of the risk of contagion in real-world scenarios.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5452.md)
