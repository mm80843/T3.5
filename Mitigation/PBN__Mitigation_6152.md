* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The rate of people coming from highly populated areas and the density of population areas are critical factors in understanding the spread rates of covid-19, with contradictory evidence on the relationship between density and infection prevalence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4281.md)
