# __Evenly distribute activity hubs throughout the city to segregate subsets of the population and inhibit rapid transmission of pathogens.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for rapid transmission of pathogens across distant neighborhoods due to uneven distribution of activity hubs in a city.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5947.md)
