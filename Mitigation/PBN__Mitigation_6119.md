# __Implement pressurization, filtration, and purification technologies including nanotechnology__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor pressurization, filtration, and purification in public spaces](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4248.md)
