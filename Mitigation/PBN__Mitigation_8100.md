# __Implementation of versatile and low-cost ieq monitoring systems alongside effective energy management solutions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Indoor environment quality ieq monitoring systems are necessary to detect energy-waste situations and contribute to developing solutions. since this is a worldwide problem, it is important to achieve versatile and low-cost ieq monitoring systems that are easy to implant in different buildings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6228.md)
