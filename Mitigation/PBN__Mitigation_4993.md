## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Disruption of main system](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3305.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Backup systems and capabilities](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3674.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Critical infrastructure should have backup capabilities and systems that can take over in the event of disruption, degradation, or loss of functionality of the main system. This ensures continuity of essential services.
