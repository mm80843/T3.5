# __Implement standardized testing and reporting procedures across different regions within a country to minimize the impact of idiosyncratic events on infection growth.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Idiosyncratic events within a country, such as holidays or backlog in testing laboratories, could generate nonuniform country-wide changes in infection growth for individual days.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9937.md)
