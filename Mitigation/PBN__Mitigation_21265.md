# __Incorporate additional factors such as population density, sanitation infrastructure, and human mobility patterns into disease risk assessment around railway stations.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Measuring the between-ness centrality of road networks surrounding railway stations may ignore other factors influencing disease spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19289.md)
