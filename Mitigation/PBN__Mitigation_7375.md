# __Ensure consistent wettability of the cu 2 o/pu film to guarantee effective viral inactivation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for incomplete inactivation of the virus due to variability in wettability of the cu 2 o/pu film](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5502.md)
