# __Enhance wearable sensor capabilities to include early symptom detection algorithms, integrate data with public health surveillance systems, and provide real-time alerts for potential outbreaks.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of wearable urban health sensors without specific virus outbreak tracking capabilities may result in delayed detection of early symptoms and contribute to the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3832.md)
