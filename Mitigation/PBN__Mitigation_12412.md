# __Conduct further study on indoor air mixing and airflow patterns to better understand virus transmission patterns.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate air mixing in rooms with a mixing ventilation system may result in atypical distribution of micro-organisms, increasing infection risk.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10501.md)
