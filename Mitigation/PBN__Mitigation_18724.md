# __Regular calibration and validation of sensing devices, and statistical analysis methods to account for variance__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential risk of data quality and accuracy due to complex sensing environments and variances in indoor environments](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16777.md)
