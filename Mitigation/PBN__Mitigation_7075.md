# __Develop and validate methodological protocols for the quantitative analysis of the virus in wbe. optimize the entire protocol including sampling, sample storage, concentration, rna extraction, and detection/quantification.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of optimization for the entire protocol from sampling to detection/quantification may lead to inaccurate results and inefficient virus analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5201.md)
