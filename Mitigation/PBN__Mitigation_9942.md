# __Establishing comprehensive data collection protocols for tests performed by age group and region, and integrating this data into national surveillance systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of systematically collected data on tests performed by age group and region can limit the understanding of infection patterns among children.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8058.md)
