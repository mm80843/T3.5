# __Consideration of airflow patterns and strategic placement of fans to minimize re-suspension, use of air purifiers to capture re-suspended particles__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased re-suspension of virus-laden particles due to desk or ceiling fans](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6200.md)
