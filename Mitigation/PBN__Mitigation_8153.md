# __Consider using higher-quality sensors for critical measurements, or implement redundant sensors for validation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Selection of lower-cost sensors for humidity and air quality measurements may compromise data accuracy and reliability.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6281.md)
