# __Build capacity to rapidly provide diagnostically confirmed malaria incidence, including the place of residence of cases__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of capacity to rapidly provide diagnostically confirmed malaria incidence in very low transmission environments](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13516.md)
