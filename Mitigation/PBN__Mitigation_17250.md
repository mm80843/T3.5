# __Implementation of air filtration systems, adoption of clean fuel technologies, and reduction of outdoor pollutant sources.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High concentration of pollutants such as particle matter in urban indoor environments, with a large proportion of ultra-fine particles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15310.md)
