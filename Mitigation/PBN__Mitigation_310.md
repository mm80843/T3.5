## Benefits linked to a risk

* [Reduction of infection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Benef/PBN__Benef_313.md)
* [Disinfection of aerosolized viral particles](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Benef/PBN__Benef_815.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Utilizes UV-C light to disinfect aerosolized bacteria and viruses suspended in the air, while keeping room occupants safe with the use of louvers or shields. Proven effective as a public health intervention to prevent the spread of airborne diseases.
