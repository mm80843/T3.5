# __Applying rigorous data filtering and validation techniques, using robust statistical methods for topic modeling, and validating results with domain experts.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate control of contagious disease spread due to the presence of statistical noise in the data processing and modeling.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20127.md)
