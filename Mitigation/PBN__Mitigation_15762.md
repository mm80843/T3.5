# __Ensure proper ventilation and airflow systems are in place to reduce the concentration of airborne pathogens. follow guidelines for external venting and airflow control to minimize the risk of indoor transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate airflow and ventilation in the built environment leading to the potential spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13837.md)
