# __Designing cost-effective and robust iaq monitoring systems tailored for rural areas, incorporating specific requirements and considering severe monitoring conditions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient iaq monitoring systems may result in prolonged exposure to poor indoor air quality, especially in rural areas where specific requirements may be overlooked.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15252.md)
