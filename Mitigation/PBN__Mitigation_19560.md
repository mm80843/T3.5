# __Careful design and implementation of uv filter glass and solar panels to ensure optimal energy production and usage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions if uv filter glass and transparent solar panels are not properly implemented.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17602.md)
