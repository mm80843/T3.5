# __Use energy-efficient hvac systems and technologies to minimize the impact of increased air fractions on energy consumption__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increasing outside air fractions may lead to increased energy consumption](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7842.md)
