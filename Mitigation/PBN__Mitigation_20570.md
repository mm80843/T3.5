# __Regular monitoring and calibration of the digital twin system, integration of real-time data validation, and periodic performance assessments.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate monitoring and maintenance of the digital twin system may lead to inaccuracies in the simulation, resulting in suboptimal decision-making and operational inefficiencies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18600.md)
