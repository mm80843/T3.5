# __Utilize appropriate estimation methods such as spatial error or spatial lag models, consider spatial heterogeneity, and perform robustness checks__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient ols estimation due to spatial structure in error terms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8033.md)
