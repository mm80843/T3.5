# __Implement robust wastewater treatment processes to reduce viral load, and monitor wastewater for early detection of viral presence.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High sars-cov-2 load in wastewater, leading to elevated concentrations of viral genomes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9404.md)
