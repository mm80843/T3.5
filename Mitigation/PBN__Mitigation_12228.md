# __Implementation of energy-efficient systems, use of low-maintenance materials, and sustainable design practices__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Intensive energy use and maintenance required for highly artificial ’green’ designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10320.md)
