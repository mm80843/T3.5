# __Implement a comprehensive metering system for all relevant electricity loads and integrate with a central monitoring system for real-time feedback.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Less than 50% of relevant electricity loads are metered, leading to poor visibility and control over electricity consumption.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16732.md)
