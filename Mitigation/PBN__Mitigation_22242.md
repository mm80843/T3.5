# __Incorporate additional metrics for disease transmission, such as air flow patterns and surface contact points, into spatial analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relying solely on physical connections for spatial analysis may overlook other modes of disease transmission, such as airborne or surface-based transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20263.md)
