## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increase in pests and disease vectors](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_2902.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The dilution effect hypothesis suggests that increasing biodiversity can reduce the abundance of infected vectors and decrease the risk of disease transmission
