# __Implement consistent airflow management strategies and consider alternative ventilation methods__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variable and unpredictable airflow patterns in naturally ventilated buildings](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9127.md)
