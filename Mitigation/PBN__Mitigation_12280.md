# __Incorporate literature from diverse subfields of architecture and environmental science to ensure a comprehensive understanding of interdisciplinary knowledge relevant to biophilic design.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited representation of interdisciplinary knowledge may restrict the applicability of biophilic design to address contagious disease propagation in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10372.md)
