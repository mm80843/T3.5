# __Implement a weighted selection mechanism for mutation operators based on empirical data and performance evaluations.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Selection of mutation operators is done randomly with equal probability, leading to unpredictable and potentially suboptimal outcomes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18008.md)
