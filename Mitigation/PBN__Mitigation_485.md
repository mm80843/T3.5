## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Planting vegetation reduces the impact of incoming solar energy by shading and reduces the accumulation of heat. However, in tropical countries with high humidity, the extent of green coverage necessary to reduce the temperature differential may lead to excessive thermal discomfort. Increased shading may be more effective under such circumstances.
