# __Conducting further research to understand the underlying reaction mechanisms and meteorological effects, and implementing measures to reduce nox concentration levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Significant increases in ozone o3 concentrations due to lower titration of o3 by no and the effects of other meteorological factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14627.md)
