# __Renewed efforts to eliminate t. b. gambiense and t. b. rhodesiense hat through reduction of the parasite reservoir using screening and treatment of humans, as well as vector control__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Neglect of surveillance activities leading to increase in hat cases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10832.md)
* [Scaling down of tsetse control campaigns leading to increase in hat cases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10833.md)
