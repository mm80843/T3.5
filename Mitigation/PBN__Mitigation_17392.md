# __Use of advanced crowd modelling techniques with accurate representations of human movement and interactions__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate representation of human movement in crowd models may lead to underestimation of disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15453.md)
