# __Implement supervised machine learning with labeled infectious and healthy periods to ensure accurate classification of covid-19 infection periods.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Managing drinking water safety measures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_8.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unsupervised machine learning used to segment data into infectious and noninfectious periods, leading to potential misclassification of covid-19 infection periods.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6922.md)
