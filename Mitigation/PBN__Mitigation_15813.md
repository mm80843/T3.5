# __Design windows that accommodate air inflow while preventing objects from being discarded__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of fresh air inflow due to reluctance to provide windows that can be opened](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13886.md)
