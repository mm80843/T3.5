# __Consideration of normalised values from previous k iterations and use of techniques such as cross-iteration batch normalization cbm__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)
