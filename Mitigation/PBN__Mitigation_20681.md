# __Validate parametrization with experimental data, consider real-world aerosol behavior, and use multiple sources of data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate parametrization of the relationship between relative humidity rh and droplet size could lead to misinterpretation of aerosol behavior and transmission dynamics.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18711.md)
