# __Implementation of high-efficiency air filtration systems and increased ventilation rates to reduce airborne pathogen concentration.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate air purification and ventilation may lead to the transmission of airborne infectious diseases within buildings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4319.md)
