# __Careful examination of the source dataset for biases, fairness-aware training techniques such as adversarial debiasing, and fairness evaluation metrics to detect and mitigate biased predictions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Utilizing a transfer learning approach with pre-trained models may introduce biases and assumptions from the source dataset microsoft coco into the human detection model, leading to biased predictions and potential fairness issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15746.md)
