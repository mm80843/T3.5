# __Conduct thorough testing and validation of the neck module to ensure it enhances performance without introducing instability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Presence of extra layers between the backbone and the head neck module may introduce additional complexity and potential points of failure in the model.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15769.md)
