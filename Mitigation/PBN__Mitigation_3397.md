## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Anti-human coronavirus spike glycoprotein](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_2547.md)
* [Fluorescent staining protocol](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_2548.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The technique detects infected cells by labeling viral antigens in host cells and assesses the reduction in infected cells after exposure to different doses of far-UVC light.
