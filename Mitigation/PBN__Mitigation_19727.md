# __Standardize the use of a single stringency index in simulations and cross-verify results for consistency.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Comparing the bentley and oxford stringency indices in simulations may lead to inconsistent r0 calculations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17767.md)
