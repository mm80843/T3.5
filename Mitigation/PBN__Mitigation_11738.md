# __Use of multiple measurement techniques, and verification of results through independent methods__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relatively low standard errors for the calculated air change rates](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9831.md)
