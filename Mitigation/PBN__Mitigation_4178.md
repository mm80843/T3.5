## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

By increasing the ventilation rates in a room, the amount of outdoor air brought in can dilute and remove indoor contaminants, reducing the risk of transmission of contagious diseases.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_294.md)
