# __Conduct comprehensive environmental impact studies on the presence of antiviral drugs and their metabolites in water bodies, develop strategies to minimize environmental exposure, and research alternative drug compounds with lower environmental impact.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Antiviral drugs, if present in low levels in the environment, could cause irreversible effects to viral genomes, leading to resistance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14254.md)
