# __Standardize the use of specific assays and validate their performance in detecting sars-cov-2 in wastewater samples.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of wastewater samples for early detection of covid-19 may lead to false positives or false negatives due to different assay sensitivities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3670.md)
