# __Implement robust error checking and data processing procedures in ’calibration’ mode to ensure accurate measurements__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate error checking and data processing in ’calibration’ mode may result in inaccurate or incomplete measurements, impacting the accuracy of disease propagation monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16786.md)
