# __Integrate regenerative design principles and living systems thinking into public health policies, building codes, and urban planning regulations to promote resilient, health-enhancing built environments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inherent tension between mechanistic, reductive scientific paradigms in green building design and emerging regenerative development approaches may impact the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7269.md)
