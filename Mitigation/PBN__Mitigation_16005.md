# __Implement ventilation assessments and design interventions to ensure adequate airflow and air exchange in the adapted spaces, considering the potential for contagion transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of proper consideration for air circulation and ventilation in adapted parking spaces may lead to increased risk of contagion transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14077.md)
