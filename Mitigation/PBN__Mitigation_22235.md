# __Carefully plan sequencing depth and rarefaction levels based on sample complexity. use statistical techniques such as rarefaction curves and extrapolation to assess sampling adequacy. consider targeted sequencing of specific taxa to improve coverage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient sampling depth and rarefaction leading to biased estimates of microbial diversity and composition.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20256.md)
