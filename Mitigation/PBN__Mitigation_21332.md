# __Conducting fine-scale urban mosquito surveillance, improving urban disease mapping, and enhancing data collection in urban environments__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Challenges in estimating urban mosquito species distributions and abundance, leading to poor estimation of urban disease exposure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19355.md)
