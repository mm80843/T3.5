# __Regular validation and adjustment of model parameters, use of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Overfitting the model could lead to inaccurate distinctions between the latent trajectory of transmission rate and noise in observations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7320.md)
