# __Standardized measurement techniques, research on different vocalizations and evaporation rates, and consideration of natural variation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variation in measurement techniques, vocalizations, and evaporation causing differing droplet distributions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6220.md)
