## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Critical infrastructure operators should ensure alternative and flexible sources of supply to minimize risks associated with global dependencies. This includes local or nearby sourcing, backup sources, and inventory buffers. The aim is to prevent disruptions in the delivery of essential resources and ensure the continuity of service.
