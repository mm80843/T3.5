# __Conduct studies on bacteria with mucus coating to understand uvgi effectiveness in real-world conditions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Bacteria studied primarily as single cells aerosolized in deionized water, lacking mucus coating, may be more sensitive to uvgi.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18094.md)
