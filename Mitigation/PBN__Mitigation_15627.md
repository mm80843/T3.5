# __Use of computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques to simulate and assess air distribution patterns, verification of ventilation effectiveness through monitoring and testing__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate assessment of air distribution effectiveness ez in confined spaces](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13702.md)
