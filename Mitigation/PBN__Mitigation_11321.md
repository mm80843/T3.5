# __Increase testing capacity, use alternative testing methods like wastewater-based epidemiology wbe to supplement clinical testing, implement efficient testing strategies for rapid and comprehensive assessment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate testing capacity for a nationâ€™s population may lead to slow and incomplete assessment of infection status, allowing for undetected spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9420.md)
