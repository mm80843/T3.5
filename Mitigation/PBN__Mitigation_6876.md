# __Limiting the use of larger-sized graphene derivatives, conducting risk assessments, and implementing protective measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Selection of materials](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_15.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Graphene derivatives with larger lateral size have stronger adsorption ability, which affects the physicochemical interaction with microorganisms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5003.md)
