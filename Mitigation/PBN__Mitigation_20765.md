# __Increase ventilation rates to the maximum supported by the system, use air purifiers to reduce virus-laden aerosols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient ventilation in makeshift hospitals may increase infection risk of opportunistic airborne transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18794.md)
