# __Research and development of improved solubility and processing methods for go.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Challenges related to poor solubility and processing of graphene oxide go may hinder the fabrication of antimicrobial coatings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5022.md)
