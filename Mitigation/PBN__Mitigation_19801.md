# __Avoid recirculation of air by maximizing outdoor air levels, applying filtration or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to remove or deactivate viral contamination, and installing secondary air circulation systems with outdoor ventilation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Recirculation of air in the built environment during an epidemic, including covid-19, can lead to the dissemination of virus-laden particles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17840.md)
