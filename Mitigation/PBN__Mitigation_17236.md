# __Use of low-power gas sensors, energy-efficient sensor nodes, and optimized sensor deployment strategies to reduce power consumption.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High power consumption of gas sensors used for iaq monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15296.md)
