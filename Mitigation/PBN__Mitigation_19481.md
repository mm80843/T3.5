# __Conducting research on aerosol transmission of covid-19 and implementing strategies to mitigate aerosol transmission in indoor environments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential aerosol transmission of covid-19, similar to previous outbreaks like sars-cov, necessitating further research and risk management actions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17522.md)
