# __Investment in research and development of improved methods for calculating conditional probability, including the use of advanced statistical and probabilistic techniques.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Difficulty in calculating conditional probability, especially when a disruption occurs for the first time.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9635.md)
