# __Optimize firmware to reduce warm-up period without compromising sensor stability, or use additional sensors to provide initial measurements during warm-up__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Samba firmware warming up period of 10 minutes may lead to delays in accessing sensor data, impacting real-time monitoring and response](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16785.md)
