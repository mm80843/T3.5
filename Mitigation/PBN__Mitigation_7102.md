# __Use a combination of biomarkers specific to the disease and confirmatory diagnostic tests to improve accuracy of disease detection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate identification of specific diseases due to biomarkers not being specific to a given disease, leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective containment measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5229.md)
