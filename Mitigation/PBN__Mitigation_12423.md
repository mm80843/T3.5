# __Conduct comprehensive research to establish standardized hvac operation requirements for effective prevention of airborne virus transmission in buildings.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Significant variations in hvac operation requirements, such as ventilation rates, indicate a research gap.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10512.md)
