# __Integrated monitoring systems to capture data on multiple ieq parameters including acoustic environment, prioritize research on the impact of acoustic environment on disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Continuous monitoring of noise levels may be less valuable in comparison with other indoor environmental quality ieq parameters.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8925.md)
