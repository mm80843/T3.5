# __Validate the relationship with experimental data, consider real-world humidity dynamics, and consult experts in aerosol transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Misinterpretation of the relationship between rh and absolute humidity ah could lead to errors in humidity control measures and disease transmission mitigation strategies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18712.md)
