# __Standardize communication protocols and implement robust data transformation and integration mechanisms.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of multiple communication protocols in iot applications can lead to interoperability issues and complexity in system integration.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6252.md)
