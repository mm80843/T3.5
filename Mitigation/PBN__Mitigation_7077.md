# __Provide training and education on the proper interpretation and understanding of results from advanced rna detection methods. validate and compare results with traditional methods to ensure accuracy and reliability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Utilization of advanced rna detection methods like crispr and dpcr for virus detection and quantification presents the risk of misinterpretation or inadequate understanding of the results compared to traditional methods like rt-qpcr.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5203.md)
