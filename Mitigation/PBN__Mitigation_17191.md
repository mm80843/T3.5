# __Developing an iaq monitoring system that operates in real-time and can provide instant alerts and guidance for preventive measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of real-time iaq monitoring can lead to delayed detection of unhealthy indoor air conditions, increasing the risk of exposure to contaminants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15251.md)
