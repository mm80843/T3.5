# __Use 5 ghz wireless frequency to reduce interference, or reposition router and devices to minimize interference.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Interference from devices using 2.4 ghz radio frequencies can reduce wi-fi speed or cause loss of internet connection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15983.md)
