# __Position sensor nodes strategically, account for environmental factors in data analysis__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Variation in values based on the position of the smart ieq sensor nodes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6316.md)
