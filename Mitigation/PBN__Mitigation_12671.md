# __Use internal reference viruses like pmmov, develop correction algorithms for flow rate variations__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unstable sewage flow rate impacted by factors including rainstorms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10760.md)
