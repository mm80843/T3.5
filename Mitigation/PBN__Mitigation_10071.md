# __Integrating sound-absorbing materials, space planning for noise reduction, and using sound-insulating construction materials__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for acoustic factors leading to noise interference between spaces](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8185.md)
