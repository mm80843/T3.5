# __Implement a redundant data transmission system using wired connections or alternative wireless technologies to ensure continuous data flow. regularly test and troubleshoot the wifi network for reliability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on wifi connectivity for ieq measurements may lead to data transmission issues and interruptions in monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6272.md)
