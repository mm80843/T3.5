## Benefits linked to a risk

* [Reduction in infection risk](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Benef/PBN__Benef_184.md)
* [Dilution of airborne contaminants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Benef/PBN__Benef_509.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Opening outdoor air dampers or windows allows for increased exchange of outdoor air, diluting indoor air contaminants
