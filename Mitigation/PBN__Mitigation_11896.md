# __Develop algorithms to filter out temperature readings from clothing and focus on skin temperature__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate body temperature measurement due to clothing interference](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9989.md)
