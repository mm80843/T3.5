# __Encourage the inclusion of a comprehensive set of covariates in future studies to improve the robustness of the analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Not all studies have used a complete number of possible covariates in the analysis, potentially leading to limited findings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10284.md)
