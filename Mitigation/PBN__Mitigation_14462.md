# __Development of lightweight ai solutions for client-side processing; optimization of ai algorithms for resource-constrained devices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited computational and memory resources for model training and deployment on iot devices, affecting the quality of healthcare ai algorithms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12544.md)
