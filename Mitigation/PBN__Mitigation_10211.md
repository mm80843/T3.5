# __Regular distribution of temperatures, control of the rate of airflow and airspeed, and use of natural ventilation to reduce the risk of infectious aerosols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate control of airflow and airspeed can lead to the transport of virus-carrying particles within indoor spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8321.md)
