# __Validation of loc-based techniques with traditional testing methods, regular calibration of detection systems, and continuous training of operators.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Widespread use of loc-based techniques for viral detection may create false positives or false negatives in diagnostic results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5206.md)
