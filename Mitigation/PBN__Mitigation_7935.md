# __Continuous monitoring and validation of machine learning predictions using multiple sources of data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Machine learning approaches applied to wearable data could tease out signals of infection or disease states.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6063.md)
