# __Develop advanced modeling techniques to isolate the effects of spatial heterogeneity in mobility datasets and improve the accuracy of urban design influence assessments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of isolation of the effects of spatial heterogeneity from all other information embedded in massive mobility datasets used as model input.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5948.md)
