# __Implementation of hybrid ventilation strategies to ensure adequate ventilation in all weather conditions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation may be compromised in cold weather, leading to reduced outdoor airflow.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10504.md)
