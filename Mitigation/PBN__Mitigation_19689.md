# __Improvement of building design for natural ventilation, promotion of open windows, and addressing the limitations of natural ventilation through alternative strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limitations of natural ventilation due to building design, sub-optimal practice, closed windows, and variable wind direction and speed.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17729.md)
