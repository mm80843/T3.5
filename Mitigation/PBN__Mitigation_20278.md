# __Adopting modular construction strategies, utilizing sustainable and health-conscious building materials, and integrating digitalization and automation in construction processes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient construction strategies and materials could contribute to suboptimal building designs and delay the implementation of health-conscious features.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18310.md)
