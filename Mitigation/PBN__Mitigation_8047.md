# __Implement measures to reduce occupancy density, enhance ventilation, and monitor air quality for early detection of infection risk.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Risk of infection in regularly attended indoor spaces due to prolonged exposure to pre/asymptomatic individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6175.md)
