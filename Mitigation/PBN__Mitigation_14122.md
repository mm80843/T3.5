# __Handle aerosolization and sampling of viruses with care to avoid unnecessary mechanical stress.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Enveloped viruses like mhv coronavirus are susceptible to inactivation by mechanical stress.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12206.md)
