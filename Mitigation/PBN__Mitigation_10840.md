# __Use of safer alternatives to create high concentrations for testing__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of dry ice and incense to create high co2 and pm2.5 concentrations](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8944.md)
