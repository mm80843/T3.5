# __Incorporate micro-level behaviors into the simulation and validate the accuracy of transmission scenarios__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for micro-level behaviors such as breathing and touching in covid-19 transmission scenarios](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19451.md)
