# __Implement measures to improve logistics, optimize network structure, and manage the complexity of supply chains.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Minimize supply chain disruptions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_32.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Characteristics of the supply chain, including logistic operations, network structure, dynamics, and complexity, determine the way major external disruptions may change performance within the supply chain.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17892.md)
