# __Utilization of advanced natural language processing models and semantic understanding algorithms for fact extraction, along with manual validation by domain experts.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of semantic understanding in plain texts may result in the extraction of incorrect fact triples, leading to misinformation in the knowledge graph.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12108.md)
