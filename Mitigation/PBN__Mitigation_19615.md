# __Adopt advancements in construction techniques to speed up the construction of emergency buildings, such as modular structures and adaptive reuse__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate construction techniques for emergency buildings , covid hospitals, quarantine tents](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17656.md)
