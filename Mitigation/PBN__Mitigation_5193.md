## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Screens or mesh materials](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3824.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

House screening involves the installation of screens or mesh materials on doors, windows, and other openings of houses to prevent mosquitoes from entering. This physical barrier effectively blocks the access of mosquitoes to humans, reducing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission within the household.
