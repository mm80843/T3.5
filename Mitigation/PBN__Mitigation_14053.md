# __Conducting region-specific energy saving assessments, adapting the dbaf design for different climate conditions, and providing climate-specific guidelines for dbaf implementation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Climate zones variability may impact the effectiveness of the dbaf, leading to varying levels of energy saving potential in different regions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12138.md)
