# __Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting, and augmentation of training data from diverse sources to improve model generalization.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Training on a large number of samples from the google open images dataset, including human body parts, increases the risk of model overfitting to specific characteristics of that dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15745.md)
