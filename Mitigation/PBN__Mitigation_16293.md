# __Consideration of population size and density in resource allocation and containment strategies, exploration of targeted interventions for larger countries.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Likelihood of new cases is still higher in large countries than small countries on a per capita basis, indicating a potential risk of disproportionate impact on larger countries.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14362.md)
