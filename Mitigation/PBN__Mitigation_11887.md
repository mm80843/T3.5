# __Standardize testing procedures to evaluate the antiviral properties of different types of copper, and communicate clear guidelines on the recommended copper materials for virus mitigation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Varied efficacy of copper surfaces based on copper content and form native, nanoparticle raises concerns about the uniformity of antiviral properties across different copper materials.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9980.md)
