# __Use of wifi range extenders, site survey for optimal placement of smart ieq sensor nodes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate wifi coverage may limit the deployment of smart ieq sensor nodes, leading to incomplete monitoring of certain areas within the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6274.md)
