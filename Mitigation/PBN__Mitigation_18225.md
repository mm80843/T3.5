# __Implement constant ventilation, periodic air quality testing, and rethinking hvac system characteristics. ensure good indoor air quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation systems in closed buildings, leading to poor air circulation and increased transmission of infectious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16284.md)
