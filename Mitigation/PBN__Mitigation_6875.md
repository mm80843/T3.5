# __Proper handling and disposal of graphene derivatives, implementation of safety protocols, and use of personal protective equipment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Ensure use of personal protection equipment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_23.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo contain oxygen functional groups hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, and epoxy that affect their physicochemical properties.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5002.md)
