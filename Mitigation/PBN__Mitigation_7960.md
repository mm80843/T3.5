# __Retrofitting existing indoor spaces to improve ventilation, lighting, and layout design.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Non-adherence to florence nightingaleâ€™s design principles for indoor environments, such as high ceilings, natural lighting, and ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6088.md)
