# __Install ventilation systems with high-efficiency particulate air hepa filters and air purification technologies. provide guidelines for proper ventilation and temperature control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited control over indoor air quality and thermal comfort in small dwellings may lead to poor ventilation and increased risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16582.md)
