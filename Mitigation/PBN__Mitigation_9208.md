# __Consult with climate and health experts to understand the true impact of weather on disease transmission, use data-driven approaches to inform policy decisions, and implement flexible response strategies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Interpreting seasonal weather effects on transmission rates may lead to false assumptions about disease control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7327.md)
