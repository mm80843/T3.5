# __Improve the efficiency of air treatment processes, enhance filtration, and redesign hvac components to minimize the escape of microscopic particles.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient treatment of outside air in hvac systems may lead to the escape of microscopic particles, including covid-19 viruses, into treated air, posing a risk of infection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8270.md)
