# __Validation of simulation models with real-world data, collaboration with experts in simulation modeling and building design__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Relying on simulation models without comprehensive data may lead to inaccurate or unreliable design principles for disease mitigation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4331.md)
