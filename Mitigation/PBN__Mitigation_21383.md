# __Incorporate airflow analysis into the simulation system, conduct cfd simulations for airflow assessment__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to consider airflow in the built environment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19405.md)
