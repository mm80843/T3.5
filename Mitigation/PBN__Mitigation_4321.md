## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Airborne transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_252.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Germicidal uv lamps](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3207.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Upper room germicidal UV fixtures disinfect large volumes of room air by decontaminating the upper two feet of the room. Air mixing, aided by low-velocity ceiling fans, helps to distribute the disinfected air throughout the room.
