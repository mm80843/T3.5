# __Incorporating contactless routes, air purification systems, and antimicrobial materials into building design.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential spread of viruses in indoor environments due to lack of contactless systems and air purification.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17601.md)
