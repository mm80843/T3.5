# __Conduct laboratory studies to understand the survivability of the virus under different environmental conditions and develop strategies to mitigate transmission based on environmental factors.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Influence of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and uv radiation on virus survivability and transmission rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6824.md)
