# __Implement proper ventilation systems and spatial design to reduce close proximity and improve airflow__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation and spatial design](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7498.md)
