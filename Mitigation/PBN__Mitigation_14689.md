# __Careful validation of algorithm output and use of multiple computational methods for verification.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Iterative solving of equations can lead to algorithmic errors and incorrect solutions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12770.md)
