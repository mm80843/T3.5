# __Enhanced door mechanisms, ventilation systems, and air filtration to limit aerosol migration.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential migration of aerosols from patient rooms into higher traffic corridors, increasing the risk of spreading airborne pathogens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7862.md)
