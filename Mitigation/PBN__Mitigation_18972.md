# __Implement noise reduction measures near bird habitats, conduct research on noise sensitivity in different species, and regulate transportation noise levels.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Chronic traffic noise hazardous to birds, leading to embryo mortality and growth issues in zebra finches.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17021.md)
