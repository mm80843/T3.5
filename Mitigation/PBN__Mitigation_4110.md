## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Direct exposure to sunlight](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_2910.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The layout of the building should be optimized for a north-south orientation, or alternative design treatments should be applied to avoid direct exposure to east-west sunlight.
