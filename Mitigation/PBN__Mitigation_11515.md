# __Developing standardized resilience metrics and indices that enable consistent measurement and comparison of dynamic resilience.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to quantify resilience value within a range of 0 and 1 for dynamic resilience.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9613.md)
