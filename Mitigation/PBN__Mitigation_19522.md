# __Bypassing energy recovery ventilation systems that have potential leaks and ensuring proper exhaust air management.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential leakage of exhaust air back into the air supply due to energy recovery ventilation systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17562.md)
