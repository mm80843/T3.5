# __Regular cleaning and disinfection of indoor surfaces can reduce the risk of fomite transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Sars-cov-2 stability enhanced by bovine serum albumin, increasing potential for fomite transmission in indoor environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5095.md)
