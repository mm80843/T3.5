# __Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of results to violations of the conditional independence assumption__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Conditional independence assumption between policy deployments and infection growth rates may not hold in real-world contexts](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9927.md)
