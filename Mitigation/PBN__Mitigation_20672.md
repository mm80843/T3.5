# __Utilize techniques such as ridge regression, principal components regression, or lasso to account for collinear regressors__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Correlated independent variables in linear regression models can lead to inflated variances of estimated coefficients and inaccurate predictions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18702.md)
