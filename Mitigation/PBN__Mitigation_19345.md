# __Incorporate additional data models, such as raster or network data, to complement vector data models in spatial analyses.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spatial analyses based solely on vector data models may limit the understanding of contagious disease spread through other data types such as raster models or network data.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17390.md)
