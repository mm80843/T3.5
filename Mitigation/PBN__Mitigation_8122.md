# __Consider using a combination of multiple technologies, such as zigbee, wifi, and mqtt, to improve network coverage and data transmission capabilities.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on bluetooth, zigbee, and wifi for communication in wireless sensor networks wsn may limit coverage and data transmission capabilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6250.md)
