# __Promote contactless charging options, implement regular sanitation of charging points and transportation facilities, and provide public health education on disease prevention.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Touchless technologies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_13.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ramping up the uptake of low emission vehicles and constructing more electric car charging points may increase human interactions within urban environments, potentially contributing to the transmission of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10113.md)
