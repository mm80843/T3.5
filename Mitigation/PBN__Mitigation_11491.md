# __Invest in engineering-focused resilience research and incorporate contagious disease preparedness into engineering design practices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited research on resilience in the engineering domain may result in inadequate preparedness for engineering-related contagious disease outbreaks.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9589.md)
