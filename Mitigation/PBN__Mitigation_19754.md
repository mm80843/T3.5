# __Thorough validation and calibration of the stringency index and compliance indicator using real-world data and simulations to ensure their effectiveness in reducing r0.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Using state-specific stringency index and compliance indicator to bring the basic reproductive number r0 to less than 1 in each state studied.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17794.md)
