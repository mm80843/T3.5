# __Careful evaluation of the data distribution and application of regularization techniques to counter overfitting__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of data augmentation techniques such as mosaic may create a false sense of data variety and lead to overfitting if not used carefully](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15771.md)
