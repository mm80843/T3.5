# __Improve ventilation systems, limit seating density, and enforce face mask usage on public transport.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Risk of infection in public transport due to limited air circulation and seating density, leading to prolonged exposure in confined environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13911.md)
