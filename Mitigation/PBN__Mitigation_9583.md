# __Conduct extensive studies to determine variability in virus excretion and shedding across individuals and the general population.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited understanding of intra-and inter-person variability in the magnitude of virus excretion/shedding.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7702.md)
