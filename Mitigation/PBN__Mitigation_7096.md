# __Development of standardized methods for determining viral load in feces and comparison with clinical data__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Large uncertainty in viral load in feces making it difficult to determine a typical value for wbe and comparison with clinical data](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5223.md)
