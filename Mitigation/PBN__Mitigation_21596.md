# __Use of assays with lower limit of detection or concentration techniques to improve detection sensitivity__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Virus concentration below the limit of detection of the assay](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19618.md)
