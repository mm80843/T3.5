# __Developing a general occupant exposure model to retrofit microscopic crowd models__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of representation of space usage of pedestrians at a microscopic scale in current disease-spreading models](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15477.md)
