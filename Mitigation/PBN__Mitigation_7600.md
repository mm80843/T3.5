# __Consider alternative ventilation methods and air distribution to minimize the risk of cross-infection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Downward ventilation may not always protect people from cross-infection due to mixing ventilation and free convection around the human body.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5727.md)
