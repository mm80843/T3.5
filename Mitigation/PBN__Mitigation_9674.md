# __Implement strict closure of recirculation dampers and use high efficiency filters in recirculation units.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to close recirculation dampers can lead to the distribution of airborne contaminants from one point to others connected to the same system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7793.md)
