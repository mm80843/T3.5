# __Integrating localized simulation data and refining the model for micro-level analysis__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Focus on a generalized model without simulation for the fine-grained location of patients](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6519.md)
