# __Integrate sensors for chemical pollutants and noise levels to provide a more comprehensive assessment of indoor environmental quality.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Exclusion of sensors for chemical pollutants and noise levels may lead to undetected exposure to harmful substances and inadequate assessment of acoustic impacts on ieq.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8922.md)
