## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Airborne transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_252.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Increases the flow of outdoor air into the building by modifying HVAC system control strategies or using dedicated fans or outdoor air units, reducing the risk of airborne transmission
