# __Conduct research to determine optimal design and arrangement of upper-room uvgi systems and consider the impact of humidity levels__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Decline in upper-room uvgi systems efficiency with rising humidity levels](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10481.md)
