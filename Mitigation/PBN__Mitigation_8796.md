# __Utilize automated feature extraction and selection techniques to ensure comprehensive and unbiased feature sets for model development.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Manual selection of physiological characteristics for anomaly detection model development may lead to biased or incomplete feature sets, impacting the effectiveness of the models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6920.md)
