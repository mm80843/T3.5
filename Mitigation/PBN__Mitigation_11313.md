# __Utilize global wastewater temperature modeling to compute wastewater temperatures and account for the effects of temperature on biomarker degradation in wastewater.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Global wastewater temperature modeling can help in predicting the impact of temperature on the degradation of biomarkers in wastewater, providing a basis for informed decision-making in public health responses.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9412.md)
