# __Implement zoning and smart ventilation control systems to ensure uniform temperature distribution and adequate ventilation in all areas.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of individual room control for cooling may lead to uneven temperature distribution and poor ventilation in certain areas, increasing the risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16734.md)
