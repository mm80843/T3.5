# __Include a margin of error in the eui estimation to account for uncertainty and variations. use more comprehensive energy modeling techniques that consider real-world variability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Social distancing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_20.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Uncertainty and variations in energy consumption may not be considered in the eui estimation model, leading to discrepancies between estimated and actual values.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9024.md)
