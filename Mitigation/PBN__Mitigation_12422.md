# __Implement measures to minimize draught and noise levels, optimize energy consumption, and reduce co2 emissions__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Adverse outcomes of increasing ventilation rate, including indoor discomfort, higher energy consumption, and increased co2 emissions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10511.md)
