# __Regular updates and revisions of ontologies to reflect new knowledge and understanding of diseases, as well as collaborative efforts to ensure comprehensive coverage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Synchronous development of ontologies with the appearance of new diseases may lead to gaps in coverage and understanding of specific disease aspects.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5416.md)
