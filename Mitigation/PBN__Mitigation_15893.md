# __Consider the potential interaction effects between covariates and green features in the models to disentangle direct and indirect effects.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inclusion of covariates such as age, gender, education level, working mode, income decrease, presence of other people, and presence of pets in the regression models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13965.md)
