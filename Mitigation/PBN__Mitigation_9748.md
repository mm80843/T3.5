# __Conduct comprehensive risk assessments to evaluate the impact of design decisions on disease transmission. implement measures such as improved ventilation, isolation capabilities, and enhanced triage systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate consideration of general facility design for different patient conditions and operational requirements may lead to increased risk of viral transmission within the hospital or healthcare facility.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7865.md)
