# __Ensure suitable ventilation rates, provide natural ventilation, use carbon dioxide tracer-gas techniques for analysis__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation in buildings, especially hospitals, leading to increased risk of airborne infection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4249.md)
