# __Implement temperature regulation systems and provide guidelines for safe window ventilation practices.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased window ventilation may expose occupants to extreme temperature profiles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7851.md)
