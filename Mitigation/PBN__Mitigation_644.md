## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Critical infrastructure should adopt a resilience-based approach that focuses on identifying and managing vulnerabilities, anticipating and adapting to changing conditions, and ensuring rapid recovery and continuity of essential services. This shift from a preventive to a resilient approach allows for better preparedness and response to unexpected events.
