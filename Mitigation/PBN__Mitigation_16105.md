# __Integration of bluetooth low energy ble with gps data to improve accuracy and range of contact tracing, and development of hybrid solutions combining both technologies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Pure gps-based contact tracing solutions lack the accuracy to identify close contacts within a few meters.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14177.md)
