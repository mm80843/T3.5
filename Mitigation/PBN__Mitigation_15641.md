# __Conduct comprehensive research to establish clear correlations and guidelines for social distance, ventilation rate, and probability of infection, implement monitoring systems to track and control pi__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of control over probability of infection pi in relation to social distance and ventilation rate](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13716.md)
