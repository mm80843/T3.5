# __Implementing ventilation systems and airflow optimization strategies to improve air circulation and reduce congestion. enforcing strict occupancy limits to prevent overcrowding in circular or elliptic rooms.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Arranging objects in circular or elliptic rooms may create congestion and limit airflow, increasing the risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12755.md)
