# __Implementation of effective ventilation systems to dilute and remove airborne contaminants, regular maintenance of ventilation systems, and awareness of the importance of ventilation in disease control__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation leading to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of airborne disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18252.md)
