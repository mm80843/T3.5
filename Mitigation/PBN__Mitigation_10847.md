# __Implementing occupancy limits, spatial reconfiguration, and scheduling to reduce crowd density, along with promoting personal hygiene and sanitation measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High occupancy density leading to increased risk of disease spread and infection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8951.md)
