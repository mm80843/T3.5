# __Establish standardized protocols for assay selection and interpretation of results from multiple assays.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of multiple assays with varying sensitivity for detecting sars-cov-2 in wastewater samples may lead to conflicting or inconclusive results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3672.md)
