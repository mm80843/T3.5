# __Standardize sensor buses to reduce complexity and improve reliability of data collection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of different sensor buses spi and i2c increases complexity and potential for technical failures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6279.md)
