# __Incorporation of dynamic arrival rate models based on real-time disease spread data__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of statistical distributions for arrival rates may not accurately capture the variability of disease spread](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16418.md)
