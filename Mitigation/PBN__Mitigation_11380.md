# __Balancing sustainable practices with indoor air quality standards, integrating natural ventilation systems, and promoting air purification technologies__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of local products and minimal energy consumption in housing may lead to compromised indoor air quality and ventilation, creating a conducive environment for disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9478.md)
