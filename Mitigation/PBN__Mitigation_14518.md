* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased adoption of iot devices in smart homes may lead to a higher density of interconnected devices, potentially facilitating the spread of contagious diseases if proper hygiene measures are not followed.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12599.md)
