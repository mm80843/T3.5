# __Invest in advanced hvac zoning systems and building automation controls to enable simultaneous heating and cooling based on occupancy and thermal load.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to simultaneously heat and cool rooms may lead to inconsistent temperature control, creating discomfort for occupants and potentially impacting their immune response, thereby increasing the risk of contagious disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16715.md)
