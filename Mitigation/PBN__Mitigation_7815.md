# __Utilize spatially-explicit disease transmission models to account for the spatial organization of human mobility, quantify the impact of population size and density on disease transmission, and adjust the model assumptions accordingly.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Assumption of homogeneous mixing in metropolitan areas can bias model results and lead to inaccurate epidemic size predictions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5945.md)
