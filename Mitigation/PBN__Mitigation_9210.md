# __Validate transmission rate estimates with multiple sources of data and incorporate uncertainty in the estimation process.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Transmission rate estimates may lead to over-estimation or under-estimation of the actual transmission rate, impacting the effectiveness of control measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7329.md)
