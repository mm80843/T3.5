# __Implement a systematic approach to determine the optimal placement of pacs based on airflow dynamics and occupancy patterns. regularly assess and adjust the placement.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Ineffective placement of pacs leading to uneven air purification and particle removal in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10496.md)
