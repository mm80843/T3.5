# __Meticulous calculations, simulations, and close monitoring of pressurization systems to ensure effectiveness__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate pressurization leading to directional airflow issues and ineffective containment of pathogens](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4258.md)
