## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Number of people in the building](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_3420.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Occupant exposure is accounted for when agents are in the same building. The number of people in the building at each time-step is used to identify occupant exposure.
