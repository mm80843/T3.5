# __Use of high-quality pcr machines with precise temperature control and regular calibration, implementation of temperature monitoring systems, and training on proper temperature control procedures__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inaccurate temperature control during pcr process leading to compromised amplification](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20258.md)
