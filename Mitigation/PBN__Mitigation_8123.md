# __Optimize energy consumption and cost of monitoring nodes through hardware and software improvements, and consider the use of low-power communication technologies like bluetooth low energy ble .__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Support recovery of sectors via remote work](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_33.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Energy consumption and cost of each monitoring node may impact the scalability and deployment of wireless monitoring systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6251.md)
