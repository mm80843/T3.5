# __Incorporate contagion risk models into route calculation algorithms to prioritize safer paths over shorter distances.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Calculation of routes based solely on distance without considering contagious disease risk levels can lead to increased exposure to high-risk areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6385.md)
