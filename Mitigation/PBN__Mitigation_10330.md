# __Implement localized grounded collecting plates and regular cleaning and maintenance of ionizers.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Accumulation of potentially infectious particles onto adjacent surfaces or grounded parts of the ionizer, leading to localized outbreak of tb-infected animals and potential risk of transmission to humans.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8440.md)
