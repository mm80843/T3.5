# __Incorporate a multidisciplinary approach that considers various factors influencing disease transmission, including social, economic, and environmental factors.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The study focuses on the relationship between green spaces and sars-cov-2 infection rates, which may oversimplify the complex factors contributing to disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20720.md)
