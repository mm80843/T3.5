# __Utilize dedicated or private gpu resources for computation, or ensure stringent cleaning and sanitization protocols for shared gpu resources.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of shared gpu resources in the google colab environment may pose a risk of exposure to contagious diseases through shared computational resources.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14431.md)
