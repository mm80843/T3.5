# __Enforce interoperability standards for sensor devices and regulate the configuration of devices to ensure compatibility.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Configuration of sensor devices by contracted corporations to be incompatible with those of their competitors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4032.md)
