# __Implementing airborne infection control policies and restructuring hospital design to address airborne infection transmission__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate hospital infrastructure for dealing with airborne infections](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4218.md)
* [Insufficient policies and infrastructure for addressing airborne infections](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4220.md)
