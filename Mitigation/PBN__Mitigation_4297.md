## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Airborne and direct transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_2991.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Reduces the concentration of virus-laden particles by decreasing the number of people who can be exposed at any given time, limiting the risk of airborne and direct transmission

## Property: has_MitigationSource
