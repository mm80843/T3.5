# __Regular inspection and maintenance of filtration systems to ensure proper sealing and functioning.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control of airflows airtight / negative pressure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_44.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate filtration techniques for removing pathogens like sars-cov-2 from shared air environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7832.md)
