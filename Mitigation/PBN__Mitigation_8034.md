# __Implement temperature control systems and consider heat production when designing ventilation strategy to minimize airflow complexity__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Complex indoor air flows due to temperature differences and heat production exacerbating viral distribution unpredictability](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6162.md)
