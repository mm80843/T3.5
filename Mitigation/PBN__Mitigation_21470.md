# __Implement low-cost and portable measurement systems using smartphones and raspberry pi for indoor noise measurements. collect additional building data such as year of construction and window type for improved assessment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Wall and floors treatment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_14.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of objective data on noise measurement and sound insulation of buildings hinders accurate assessment of indoor noise sources.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19492.md)
