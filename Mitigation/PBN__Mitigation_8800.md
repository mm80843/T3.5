# __Standardize accuracy measures, establish clear criteria for sensitivity and specificity values, and ensure transparency in reporting accuracy results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Social distancing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_20.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inconsistent accuracy results and heterogenous specificity and sensitivity values in wearable technology for covid-19 detection, leading to uncertainty in the performance of the technology.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6924.md)
