# __Incorporate additional data on shedding rates from diverse sources, and validate the models using empirical studies and clinical data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Modeling the shedding rate of sars-cov-2 rna copies/g of feces as a log-uniform distribution may introduce variability that impacts the accuracy of infection prevalence estimates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3663.md)
