# __Further research to understand the complex interactions between deer, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens, and development of targeted interventions based on the findings.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Conflicting impact of deer density on tick-borne infections, with some studies suggesting a reduction and others indicating an increase in infections.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19147.md)
