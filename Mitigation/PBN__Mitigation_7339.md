# __Conduct further experimental studies to gather more data on uv-c irradiation of airborne coronaviruses__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Paucity of good quality data on uv-c irradiation of sars-cov-1, sars-cov-2, and mers-cov in the air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5466.md)
