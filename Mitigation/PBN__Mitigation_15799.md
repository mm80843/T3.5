# __Incorporate containment spaces for walk-in patients, consider spatial layout of wards, operating theatres, and emergency departments, and implement compartmentalized ventilation management with well-thought-out pressure differentials__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Hospitals designed without containment spaces for walk-in patients and visitors, without internal containment options between wards, and without containment options in emergency departments](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13872.md)
