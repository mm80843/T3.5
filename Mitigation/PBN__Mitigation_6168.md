# __Balancing airflow rates with ventilation needs, implementing air purification technologies, and considering spatial configurations to minimize transmission possibilities.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for increased transmission of contagious diseases due to elevated airflow rates and recirculated indoor air delivery.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4297.md)
