# __Promoting proper ventilation strategies, implementing air filtration systems, and educating occupants on window-opening behavior.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increase in air change rate due to window-opening behavior leading to variability in indoor air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9857.md)
