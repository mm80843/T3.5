# __Implementing adaptable modular systems and flexible furniture that can be easily reconfigured for different functions__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inefficient modular system leading to inadequate adaptation of spaces for multiple functions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8184.md)
