# __Use technology to adjust air flow rates dynamically based on user feedback and environmental conditions, and design nozzles to minimize draught effects.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Draught felt by people at high air flow rates from personalized air supply nozzles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5734.md)
