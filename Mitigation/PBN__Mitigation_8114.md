# __Explore the potential of electronic noses based on mos and mems technologies for low-cost, stable detection of gaseous air pollutants.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of suitable chemical analysis technologies to determine the concentration of gaseous air pollutants specifically and sensitively at low-cost, posing challenges for long-term, stable detection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6242.md)
