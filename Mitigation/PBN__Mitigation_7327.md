# __Implement targeted uv-c disinfection methods for viruses suspended in liquid.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Disinfection of air](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_6.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Aerosolised viruses appear to be more vulnerable to uv damage than when they are suspended in a liquid or on a substrate.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5454.md)
