# __Implement stratified sampling techniques to ensure representation from contractors of different sizes and geographic locations. use random sampling within each stratum to mitigate bias.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Sampling control may be ineffective, leading to a biased representation of contractors nationwide.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20224.md)
