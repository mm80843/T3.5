# __Implement a comprehensive infection control strategy that includes a combination of ventilation optimization, air filtration, and other proven infection control measures in addition to guv systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential reliance on upper-room germicidal uv guv systems as the primary control measure, leading to neglect of other essential infection control strategies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17839.md)
