# __Develop a crowd behavior model for the simulation system, integrate queuing and grouping behaviors into the model__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Occupancy control eg separating at/risk contaminated population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_40.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of crowd behavior model in the simulation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19406.md)
