# __Focusing on strict enforcement of quarantine measures and resource allocation to support self-protection efforts in less stringent quarantine scenarios.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Quarantine support](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_30.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Self-protection measures were effective in reducing the number of infected humans and delaying the arrival of the peak number of infected humans, but had little effect under stricter quarantine measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6528.md)
