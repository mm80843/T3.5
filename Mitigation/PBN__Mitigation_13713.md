# __Development of more sensitive detection methods for infectious sars-cov-2 particles in treated sewage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to detect infectious sars-cov-2 particles in the treated sewage despite the presence of viral rna fragments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11801.md)
