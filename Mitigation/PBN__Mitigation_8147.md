# __Implementation of sleep modes for sensors, use of energy-efficient sensor models, periodic energy consumption audits.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient energy efficiency measures for smart sensors may result in higher energy consumption and reduced autonomy of the monitoring system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6275.md)
