# __Develop customizable sensor modules or interface options to adapt to diverse built environment scenarios and specific ieq monitoring requirements.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of sensor customization and flexibility in ibem limits its adaptability to different ieq monitoring scenarios.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8974.md)
