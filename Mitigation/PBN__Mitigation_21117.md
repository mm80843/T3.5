# __Conducting detailed ecological assessments to tailor tick control methods to specific geographic locations and ecological contexts. research and development of location-specific tick control strategies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inconsistent effectiveness of tick control methods in different ecological contexts, as demonstrated by the differing results of pyrethrin-soaked cotton fibers in different geographic locations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19145.md)
