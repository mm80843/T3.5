# __Introduce energy efficiency improvements to reduce energy consumption, enhance indoor air quality, and mitigate the risk of disease transmission.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Low energy efficiency in bacs may result in increased energy consumption and compromised indoor air quality, impacting public health and disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16679.md)
