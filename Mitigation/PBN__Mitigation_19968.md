# __Validate simulation results with real-world data and on-site observations to ensure the accuracy of the simulation models. implement a comprehensive quality assurance process for the energy simulation software to minimize the risk of errors.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on energy simulation software like energyplus for evaluating occupant distribution patterns and hvac system performance introduces the risk of inaccuracies in the simulation results, leading to suboptimal decisions for disease mitigation and energy efficiency.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18006.md)
