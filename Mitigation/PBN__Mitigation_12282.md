# __Installation of advanced ventilation systems, regular air quality monitoring, and use of air purification technologies.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation and air circulation in biophilic design buildings leading to poor indoor air quality and increased risk of airborne contagions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10374.md)
