# __Implement regular calibration of sensors and use standard calibration procedures to ensure accuracy of measurements.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of sensors without proper calibration could lead to inaccurate measurements of iaq parameters.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15275.md)
