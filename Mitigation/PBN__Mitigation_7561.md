# __Conduct further research to understand the influence of age and gender on droplet generation and transmission risk.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [No significance was found in the effect of age and gender on droplet generation, potentially leading to underestimation of transmission risk in different demographic groups.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5688.md)
