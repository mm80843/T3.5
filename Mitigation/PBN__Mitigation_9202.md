# __Incorporate historical and real-time data to capture changing transmission dynamics, use dynamic modeling techniques.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Using a constant transmission rate assumption before the first lockdown may not accurately capture the changing transmission dynamics.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7321.md)
