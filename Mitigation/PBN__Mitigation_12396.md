# __Customized system designs based on building parameters, incorporation of displacement ventilation systems, and regular performance evaluation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Use of smart/innovative air quality controls technology](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_0.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence of upper-room uvgi system effectiveness on building parameters and system design.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10485.md)
