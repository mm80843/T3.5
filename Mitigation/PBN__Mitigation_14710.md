# __Utilization of space planning techniques to optimize seating arrangements, implementation of occupancy limits, and use of dynamic space models for adaptive planning__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Risk of inefficient space planning leading to close proximity and increased risk of disease spread](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12791.md)
