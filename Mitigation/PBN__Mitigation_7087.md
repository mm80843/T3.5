# __Development of a paper-based biosensor for sars-cov-2 detection in wastewaters and validation of its reliability for wastewater analysis.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Absence of a paper-based device to detect sars-cov-2 in wastewaters increases the risk of undetected viral presence in the environment and potential transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5214.md)
