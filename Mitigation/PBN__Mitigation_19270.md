# __Implement vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying, to reduce the proliferation of anopheles mosquitoes.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased rainfall leads to increased prevalence of the anopheles vector, resulting in a greater need for malaria control strategies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17315.md)
