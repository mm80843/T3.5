# __Develop domain-specific models and indices that capture the unique characteristics of contagious disease propagation in different built environments.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of domain-specific representation in quantitative resilience approaches may result in overlooking unique factors relevant to contagious disease propagation in different environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9592.md)
