# __Implement energy-efficient hardware and optimize software for reduced energy consumption.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Possible overconsumption of energy by the iot devices leading to increased operational costs.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6288.md)
