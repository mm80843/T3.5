# __Careful consideration of spatial layout and allocation, and potentially rethinking the design of rear extensions to accommodate a containment space.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Rear extensions do not allow for a ready installation of a containment space without sacrificing room functionality or garden space.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13819.md)
