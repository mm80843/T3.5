# __Conduct thorough health impact assessments and implement rigorous monitoring of electromagnetic field levels near 5g infrastructure sites.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Rapid deployment of 5g infrastructure without proper guidelines and monitoring may contribute to electromagnetic field exposure and public health concerns.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4051.md)
