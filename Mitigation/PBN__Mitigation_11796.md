# __Use larger sample sizes, refine data collection methods, and apply advanced statistical analysis techniques to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of individual policy effects assessment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Statistical noise in individual policy effects may lead to uncertainty in their impact on reducing infection rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9889.md)
