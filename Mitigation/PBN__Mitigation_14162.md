# __Use of amalgam technology to stabilize temperature and extend effective life, control operating power to maintain uv-c performance__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Fluorescent lamp efficiency falling below 70% in uv-c range at low temperatures and airflow](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12246.md)
