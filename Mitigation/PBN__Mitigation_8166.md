# __Implement redundant monitoring and control systems to distribute the risk of system failure. regular maintenance and testing of the central system to ensure its reliability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Centralization of the ieq monitoring system may lead to a single point of failure for the entire system, increasing the risk of widespread impact if the central system fails.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6294.md)
