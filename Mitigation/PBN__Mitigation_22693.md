# __Use regularization techniques , lasso, ridge to prevent overfitting, and validate models with independent datasets.__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Conducting multiple regression models may lead to the risk of overfitting and misleading results due to the large number of predictor variables.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20710.md)
