# __Implement thorough sensitivity analysis and model validation to assess the impact of time-varying factors on the overall model.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Time-varying models and factors introduce additional complexity and potential for error in modeling and estimation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17776.md)
