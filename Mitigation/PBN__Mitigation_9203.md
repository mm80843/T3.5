# __Use a well-defined and validated prior for the dynamics of b, and consider using multiple models for comparison.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unclear prior for dynamics of b may lead to inaccuracies in model predictions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7322.md)
