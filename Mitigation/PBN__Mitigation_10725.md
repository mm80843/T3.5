# __Use random parameter models to account for unobserved heterogeneity, and incorporate maximum simulated likelihood procedures for estimation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Unobserved heterogeneity in regression models can lead to biased estimates and incorrect conclusions about the impact of built and natural environments on the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8830.md)
