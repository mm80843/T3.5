# __Developing multimodal and multiplexed sensors to extend functionality and provide additional information for compensation and calibration.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Wearable sensors may not be practical to wear many different sensors at one time, leading to limited data collection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4721.md)
