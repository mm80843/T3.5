# __Redesigning layouts to widen corridors, installing air purifiers, and controlling the flow of visitors to minimize congregation in common areas.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spatial separation and narrow corridors can create bottlenefks and bottlenecks that increase the likelihood of close contact and the spread of pathogens between individuals passing through the area.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13832.md)
