# __Consider increasing the sample size or using statistical techniques to account for the limited sample size.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Small sample size of 30 may not capture the full variability of the population, leading to limited generalizability of the findings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14485.md)
