# __Explore alternative air disinfection technologies and strategies to complement ventilation, and consider the integration of multiple control measures to optimize airborne pathogen control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The south african study demonstrated that achieving greater protection from airborne pathogens through air changes ach became increasingly challenging, with smaller increments in protection requiring significantly higher equivalent air changes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17710.md)
