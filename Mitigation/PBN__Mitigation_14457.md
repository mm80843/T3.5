# __Develop semantic-aware and dynamics-aware modeling techniques, integrate disparate sensor data for analysis and decision making__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Smart buildings and robots must grasp spatial indoor topology, semantics, and dynamic information to serve people effectively](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12539.md)
