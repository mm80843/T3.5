# __Conduct thorough research and testing to understand the health effects of reactive ions and oxygen species, and implement appropriate measures to mitigate any potential harm.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Nbpi may produce reactive ions and reactive oxygen species in the air, which could have unknown health effects.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17627.md)
