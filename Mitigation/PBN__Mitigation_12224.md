# __Utilize sensors and monitoring technology to quantify exposure time and contact frequency, and integrate data into design decisions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate quantification of exposure time to nature and contact frequency may result in suboptimal biophilic design outcomes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10316.md)
