# __Use advanced sensor arrays and data analysis techniques to capture and analyze spatio-temporal variations in ieq parameters.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Varied spatial and temporal distribution of indoor environmental parameters , air speed, air pollution concentrations increase the complexity of accurate ieq monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16801.md)
