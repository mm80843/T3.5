# __Validate kalman filter data with real-world observations, combine data from multiple sources to cross-verify transmission rates, and implement transparency in the methodology used for estimation__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Estimation of transmission rates using population-based kalman filters may result in inaccurate data if not properly validated](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7328.md)
