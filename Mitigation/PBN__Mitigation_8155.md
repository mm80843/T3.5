# __Explore cost-effective alternatives, seek funding for equipment, prioritize sensor deployment based on critical monitoring areas.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Absorb resource shortages](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_34.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher cost of certain sensors may limit widespread deployment, reducing coverage and accuracy of environmental monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6283.md)
