# __Improvement of ventilation systems, use of improved cooking systems, and proper choice of fuel.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Excessive concentration of total suspended particles in poorly ventilated kitchens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15319.md)
* [Poor ventilation leading to reduced indoor air quality, causing health issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15320.md)
