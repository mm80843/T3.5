# __Establish validation standards specific to covid-19 detection for wearable technology, and ensure consistency in reference tests and accuracy measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Selection of materials](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_15.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of validation standards for wearable technology used in early detection of covid-19, leading to inconsistent accuracy results and unreliable performance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6923.md)
