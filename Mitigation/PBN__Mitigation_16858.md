# __Develop standardized coding guidelines and provide coder training to ensure consistent interpretation and application of coding criteria.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Staff training / upskilling](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_22.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Coding criteria for positive characteristics, functioning, and emotion are complex and open to subjective interpretation, potentially leading to inconsistent coding and scoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14922.md)
