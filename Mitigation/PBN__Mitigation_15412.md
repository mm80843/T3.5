# __Implement cross-border collaboration and information sharing to coordinate malaria control efforts. conduct targeted vector control and surveillance at border areas to prevent parasite importation and exportation.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High movement rates drive parasite flows across the region, creating areas that are simultaneously both major sources and sinks of parasites.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13488.md)
