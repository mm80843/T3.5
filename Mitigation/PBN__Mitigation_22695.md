# __Incorporate broader environmental and social determinants of health into the analysis, such as air quality, population density, and community mobility.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Examining the optimal distance from forest for its association with infection rates may neglect the impact of other environmental and social determinants of health in disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20712.md)
