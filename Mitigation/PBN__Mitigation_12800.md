# __Rotation of different types of spatial repellents, development of novel repellent formulations, and surveillance of mosquito populations for resistance.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Animal vectors control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_16.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The use of spatial repellents in combating vector-borne diseases could lead to the development of resistance in mosquito populations, rendering the repellents ineffective.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10889.md)
