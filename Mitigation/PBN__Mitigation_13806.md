# __Utilize spatial analysis and modeling to understand the spatial scale effect of non-contact interaction and optimize the location and distribution of community service facilities.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Significant spatial scale effect of non-contact interaction activities may lead to complex and variable impacts on community service facilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11893.md)
