# __Regular maintenance of ventilation systems, use of air purifiers, and monitoring of tracer concentrations__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Tracer concentrations exceeding safe levels due to poor mixing and ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9835.md)
