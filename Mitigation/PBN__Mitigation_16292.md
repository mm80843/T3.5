# __Further assessment of model fit and exploration of alternative models for the median may improve the accuracy of predictions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The analysis suggests that the model is weakest at the median 50th quantile , which may indicate that the model is poorly fit for the average case.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14361.md)
