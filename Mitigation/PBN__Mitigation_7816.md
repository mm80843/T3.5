# __Incorporate interaction kernels and spatially-dependent transmission parameters to capture non-residential processes in disease transmission models, refine the representation of local and remote environmental conditions, and validate the model outputs with real-world data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited representation of non-residential processes in disease transmission models may impact the accuracy of environmental health impact assessments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5946.md)
