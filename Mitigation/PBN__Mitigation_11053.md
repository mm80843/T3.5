# __Proper maintenance and operation of heat recovery equipment, avoidance of rotary heat exchangers, and monitoring of pressure differentials between zones.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate heat recovery equipment leading to improper air pressure differentials and ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9154.md)
