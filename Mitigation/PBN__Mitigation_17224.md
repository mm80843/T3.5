# __Implement real-time monitoring systems for iaq parameters and integrate with hvac systems for immediate control and adjustment.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
