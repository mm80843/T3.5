# __Expand clinical testing capacity, supplement clinical testing with alternative methods like wastewater-based epidemiology wbe , invest in rapid and cost-effective testing technologies and infrastructure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited clinical testing capacity compared to population size may result in slow and costly screening processes, hindering effective assessment and management of contagious disease spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9422.md)
