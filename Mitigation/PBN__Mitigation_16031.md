# __Incorporate traffic flow analysis and ventilation systems design to optimize the movement of vehicles and reduce congestion__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of consideration for peak period movements and vehicle turnover frequency may lead to congestion and increased risk of disease transmission in the parking area](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14103.md)
