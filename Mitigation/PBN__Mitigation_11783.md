# __Combine statistical approaches with process-based models to capture a more comprehensive understanding of disease propagation; validate statistical findings with empirical data.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Reliance on statistical approaches may overlook important factors impacting disease propagation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9876.md)
