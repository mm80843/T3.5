# __Implement non-contact screening methods__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to screen suspected infectors due to large-scale and fast-moving population](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4090.md)
* [Physical contact during traditional screening methods leading to infection risk](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4092.md)
