# __Implement automated occupancy monitoring systems, use electronic counters, and enforce strict occupancy limits through access control systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Shift controls occupancy control of total users](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_41.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited occupancy measures may not be effectively enforced without proper control measures or technologies, leading to overcrowding and increased risk of physical interactions and disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10218.md)
