# __Regular cleaning and maintenance of the microfluidic elements, proper disposal of contaminated materials, and implementation of strict infection control protocols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Complex microfluidic systems with interconnected networks may be prone to contamination and spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5204.md)
