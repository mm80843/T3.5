# __Use smoothing techniques to manage noise in the precision / recall curve before calculating area under the curve auc .__

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Noisy precision / recall curve may make it difficult to estimate model performance for object detection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14421.md)
