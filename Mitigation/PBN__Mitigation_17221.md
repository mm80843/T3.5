# __Regular maintenance and calibration of sensor units, and verification of data accuracy through cross-validation with standard monitoring methods.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of sensor nodes to measure gaseous pollutants may lead to potential contamination if not properly maintained.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15281.md)
