# __Implement energy-efficient iot devices and systems, optimize network configurations, and explore alternative energy sources for iot infrastructure.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Higher energy consumption of wifi infrastructure compared to other options may impact operational costs and sustainability of the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6253.md)
