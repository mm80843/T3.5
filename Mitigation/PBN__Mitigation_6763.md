* [Social distancing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_20.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Standard-62.1 and standard-90.1 focus on thermal comfort, ventilation, and energy efficiency without considering pandemics, potentially leading to inadequate measures for controlling contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4889.md)
