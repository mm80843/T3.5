# __Augment convection currents with mechanical ventilation systems or inexpensive mixing fans.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence on natural convection currents for effective uv light efficacy, which may not be sufficient in all environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8435.md)
