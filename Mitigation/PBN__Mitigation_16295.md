# __Consult with epidemiologists and public health experts to gain a comprehensive understanding of disease transmission dynamics.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of quantile regression to analyze covid-19 transmission may oversimplify the complex nature of disease diffusion and transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14364.md)
