# __Implementing strategies to address disparities, such as zoning control, maintenance priority planning, and targeted improvements in constrained areas.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limiting changes to certain building systems due to constraints may result in uneven distribution of energy efficiency improvements, leading to potential performance and health disparities within the building.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16659.md)
