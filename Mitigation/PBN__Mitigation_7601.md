# __Optimize ventilation systems for different patient positions and consider the use of air curtains or barriers to contain exhalation jets.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Displacement ventilation performs worse when patients are lying sideways, leading to the persistence of exhalation jets over a long distance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5728.md)
