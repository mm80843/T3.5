# __Consistent mapping of temporal representations, adherence to standardized ontology design patterns, and continuous validation of logical consistency.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Logical inconsistency due to the link between bfo and gfo in the obo landscape may lead to incompatible temporal regions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16116.md)
