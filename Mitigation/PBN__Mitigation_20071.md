# __Optimizing room airflow and ventilation systems to ensure uniform exposure to uvgi and minimize dead zones.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Dependence of uvgi efficacy on airflow conditions in the room.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18107.md)
