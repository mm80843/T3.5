# __Development of scalable and adaptable ieq monitoring systems for diverse built environments, incorporating wireless and autonomous technologies for wide sensor coverage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited scale and scope of proof-of-concept or project-specific ieq monitoring systems may hinder their widespread implementation in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16830.md)
