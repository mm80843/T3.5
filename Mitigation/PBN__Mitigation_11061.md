# __Regular monitoring and maintenance of pressure differentials, use of mechanical ventilation systems to maintain airflow direction__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Failure to maintain pressure differentials leading to inadequate cleanliness control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9162.md)
