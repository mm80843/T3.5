# __Combine uv irradiation with comprehensive cleaning and disinfection strategies for surfaces, and integrate it with air purification and filtration systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The susceptibility of coronavirus to uv irradiation, while effective, may not eliminate the risk of disease transmission through other means, such as surface contamination and airborne particles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8382.md)
