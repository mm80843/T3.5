# __Redesign office buildings to incorporate infectious disease control features, such as improved ventilation, air filtration, and layout modifications to reduce crowding.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Office buildings were not designed with sufficient consideration for infectious disease control, leading to an increased risk of viral spread within the workplace.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16447.md)
