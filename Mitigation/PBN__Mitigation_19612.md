# __Combine touchless technology with regular manual cleaning and disinfection processes to ensure comprehensive pathogen control.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased use of touchless technology and automation may lead to overreliance on these systems and neglect of manual cleaning and disinfection processes, resulting in higher transmission rates of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17653.md)
