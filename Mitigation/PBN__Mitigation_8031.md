# __Focusing efforts on estimating the change in likelihood of airborne infection under different scenarios and assumptions.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Challenging to quantify occupantsâ€™ exposure to airborne virus particles, leading to difficulty in estimating the likelihood of airborne infection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6159.md)
