# __Further research on the ventilation rate needed to minimize transmission of airborne viruses, and development of specific guidelines for pandemic-related ventilation standards__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of clear ventilation rate guidelines for minimizing airborne virus transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4891.md)
