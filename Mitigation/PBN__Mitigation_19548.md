# __Proper installation and maintenance of mechanical ventilation systems, including regular inspection and cleaning of ventilation components__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate mechanical ventilation systems may fail to regulate good indoor air quality and control infection transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17589.md)
