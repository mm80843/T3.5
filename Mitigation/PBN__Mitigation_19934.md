# __Implement sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of different parameters and transmission mechanisms on the modelâ€™s results.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Difficulty in accurately modeling covid-19 virus infection due to indeterminate parameters and complex transmission mechanisms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17972.md)
