# __Carefully consider the positioning and number of ventilation inlets and outlets to reduce the risk of infection. evaluate the impact on airflow patterns, air exchange, and environmental monitoring.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [The use of screens may mitigate the risk of transmission for larger droplets, but may not effectively reduce the risk of airborne transmission smaller droplets or droplet nuclei .](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6206.md)
