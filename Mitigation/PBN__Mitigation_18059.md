# __Thorough user testing and feedback collection, clear documentation of ontology design choices, and continuous refinement based on user feedback.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Facilitate transparent communication](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_37.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of the entity-quality eq model or the adaptation of the resources, events, agents rea model for ontology evaluation may introduce semantic and logical complexities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16117.md)
