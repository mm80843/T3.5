# __Implement a circle packing algorithm that ensures a minimum distance between circles to simulate social distancing.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Optimize users flows to prevent contamination](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_17.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Overlap of circles in the two-dimensional space, leading to potential transmission of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12778.md)
