# __Ensure that upper-room guv is designed to provide an average uv fluence rate within the recommended range and installed to provide uniform uvgi distribution__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential ineffectiveness of upper-room guv in killing or inactivating airborne microorganisms due to inadequate uv fluence rate or non-uniform uvgi distribution](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17834.md)
