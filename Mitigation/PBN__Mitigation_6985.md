# __Improving ventilation systems, increasing air changes per hour, and implementing effective filtration measures to reduce the spread of aerosols.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor ventilation in the restaurant led to the spread of covid-19 through aerosol transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5113.md)
