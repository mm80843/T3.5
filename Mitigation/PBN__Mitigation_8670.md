# __Regular calibration and validation of wearable sensors, in combination with other detection methods, can help improve accuracy.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Early detection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_31.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Wearable sensors may not accurately detect airborne pathogens, leading to false sense of security.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6796.md)
