# __Development of flexible building designs that can adapt to emergency measures without compromising sustainability.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Introduce "multi-use" / modular designs](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_28.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [During emergency situations such as pandemics, strategies referred to the built environment may be adopted in order to guarantee the normal building operation and business continuity.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18726.md)
