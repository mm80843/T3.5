# __Utilize real-time data analysis and adaptive modeling techniques to account for the rapidly evolving nature of covid-19 data, and integrate dynamic risk assessment protocols for built environment measures.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inability to detect statistically significant relationships between built environment measures and covid-19 infection and mortality rates due to fluid and rapidly evolving nature of covid-19 data.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8804.md)
