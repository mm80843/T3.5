# __Conduct airflow simulations and use hvac systems to improve ventilation, consider air purifiers__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Potential for suboptimal airflow within spaces due to complex geometry and constraints](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12750.md)
