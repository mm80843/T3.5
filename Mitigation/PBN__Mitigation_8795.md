# __Develop device-agnostic anomaly detection models by incorporating data from multiple devices and standardizing data formats.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Air filtration](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_2.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Anomaly detection models relying on wearable technology data may not be device-agnostic, leading to limitations in generalizability and applicability to different devices.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6919.md)
