# __Calibration and validation of off-the-shelf transducers to ensure accuracy of data collection.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Use of off-the-shelf transducers may lead to inaccuracies in data collection for thermal comfort field studies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16829.md)
