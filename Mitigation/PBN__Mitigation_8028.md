# __Increase ventilation rates, reduce duration of exposure, and reduce aerosol sources through occupancy control and masks__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Maintenance / decontamination of building water sytems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_9.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation leading to increased residence time of small aerosols](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6156.md)
