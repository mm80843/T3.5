# __Standardize monitoring methods and data analysis processes across communities, and use calibration procedures such as inverse regression of qpcr cycle thresholds with known infection rates.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Comparison of infection rates between communities using wbe monitoring data requires careful calibration and standardization procedures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7707.md)
