# __Consult with hvac engineers and experts to develop and implement safe and effective modification strategies for hvac systems.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Control airflows in spaces & avoid air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_42.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Modification of hvac control strategies may not be straightforward and could lead to unintended consequences for temperature, humidity, and air flow distribution.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17844.md)
