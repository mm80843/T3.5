# __Strategically plan the placement of sensor nodes based on building layout and occupancy patterns. use a combination of fixed and mobile sensor nodes to ensure comprehensive coverage.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Deployment of smart ieq sensor nodes anywhere in the premises may lead to incomplete or uneven coverage of monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6271.md)
