# __Use additional data sources for contact points outside of high population density areas__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Infection tracking / monitoring](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_29.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High-resolution population density data used to define areas, potentially leading to high population density contact points](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8691.md)
