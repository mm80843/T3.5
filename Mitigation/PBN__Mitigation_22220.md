# __Implementing targeted sampling and analysis strategies for indoor microbial diversity, considering different spatial and temporal scales.__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Monitor and control indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_3.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Spatial and temporal scale impact on the processes that give rise to patterns of diversity in indoor microbial communities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20241.md)
