# __Implementing measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission, enhancing the resilience of built assets, and integrating infection control into building design__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Environmental parameters control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_1.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Infectious pandemics necessitate new strategies in the built environment to prevent disease transmission and increase resilience](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18769.md)
