# __Careful evaluation of the validity and reliability of the mathematical modeling studies before including them in the review__

## Main intervention linked to the Mitigation

* [Raising awareness](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP_Intervention/PBN__BP_Intervention_38.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inclusion of studies using mathematical modelling for simulations and predictions may present a risk of bias in the review](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10254.md)
