* The context of this blueprint pertains to the risks revolving around the spread of contagious diseases in human-inhabited infrastructure, primarily within green buildings neighbourhoods. The essence of green buildings is inherently beneficial to the environment; they exploit resources such as energy and water effectively while providing a healthier living environment. Yet, these infrastructure-run intensive human activities bridge the gap between zoonotic diseases and human populations. Scores of individuals, including healthcare workers, building occupants, employees, and visitors in indoor spaces, are at risk, hence the necessity for this blueprint. 

* Infectious diseases like influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, and zoonotic diseases are widespread through carriers, surfaces, direct and indirect contacts, and even air. The risk of transmission increases during travel, close contact situations, and through respiratory mechanisms. Other factors to consider are asymptomatic transmission, fecal-oral transmission, and hidden transmission channels. Besides, mother-to-child transmission and communal transmission interactions can fuel the spread further. At this juncture, the virulent potential of bacterial growth becomes a pivotal element, increasing the risks associated with these infrastructure-intensified spaces.

* To mitigate these potential risks, a range of measures is proposed in the blueprint, applicable to an array of stakeholders who can carry out the interventions. Employing filtration mechanisms and implementing personal protective equipment can help contain the spread of diseases. Additionally, incorporating Upper-Room UVGI systems can kill disease-causing microbes, leading to safer environments. Introducing natural ventilation can also help reduce pathogen load in indoor environments. Stakeholders like individuals, building owners, facility managers, organizations, and office managers can implement these measures to ensure a safer infrastructure.

* Implementing this mitigation blueprint would lead to a host of benefits. It significantly reduces the risk of infection and prevents viral transmission in the infrastructure, thereby securing the health and safety of the inhabitants. In addition to safeguarding public health, this blueprint works toward the improved asset value of the businesses, organizations, or individuals involved. Given the health and commercial benefits combined, utilizing this blueprint offers a win-win situation for all parties.
