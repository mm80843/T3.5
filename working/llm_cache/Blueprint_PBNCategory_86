* The Blueprint that has been developed is set to mitigate risks related to hygiene, sanitation, and access to clean water in a green-building environment. The emphasis on green buildings underscores their unique structure and systems compared to conventional buildings, including the use of renewable energy, stricter waste management, and enhanced indoor environment quality, all of which serve to increase overall health and wellness. However, such infrastructural innovation brings new risks, particularly regarding sanitation and water access. 

* The primary risks identified in this Blueprint are related to inadequate facilities and conditions, and poor hygiene practices due to lack of access to clean water and sanitation systems. These risks don't only put the health and safety of building occupants in danger but also have significant implications for visitors, employees, healthcare workers, and ultimately, the general population. The lack of careful handling may lead to the spread of various contagious diseases among populations in, around, and even beyond the green buildings communities.

* In addressing these risks, the mitigation measures put forth in this Blueprint include increasing the cleaning frequency, improving sanitation infrastructure, and promoting hygiene education. There's also an emphasis on reinforcing access to clean drinking water and enhancing the wastewater management systems. In addition, regular education and reminder about proper hygiene practices, and provision of cleaning supplies and hand sanitizers are some of the crucial steps outlined. Various stakeholders, including building owners, facility managers, and government agencies, are tasked with the implementation of these measures.

* An array of benefits arises from the implementation of these mitigation measures. Foremost is the provision of cleaner and more efficient fuel. Additionally, there will be significant progress in access to water and sanitation, which indirectly impacts the health of the population. Improved hand hygiene practices being another obvious payoff. Ultimately, the blueprint will contribute greatly to ensuring a healthier and safer environment in green buildings neighborhoods.
