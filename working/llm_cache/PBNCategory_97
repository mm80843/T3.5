This category of Risks describes the potential for the spread and presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. It includes the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through wastewater, both detected and undetected. The decay of the virus in wastewater, as well as the poor removal of SARS-CoV-2 fragments in wastewater treatment, are also highlighted as risks. Additionally, the low sensitivity of current assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage and the lack of a standardized method for detection in environmental samples are mentioned as challenges. The presence and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage are also included in this category, along with the potential use of wastewater as a data source for monitoring the virus. Overall, these risks pertain to the contamination and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems.
