* Given the outlined risks related to construction projects in green buildings neighborhoods during contagious diseases spread, it is recommended to implement the offered blueprint. In layman's terms, this blueprint offers a comprehensive plan to address various issues. It includes employing remote work possible areas, ensuring communication is effective and clear, creating contingency plans and timelines that can be adjusted depending on the situation. The blueprint also proposes designing buildings in such a way that the size, location, and orientation of openings are optimized to minimize mosquito access. Lastly, use of technology such as communication tools, layers, occupancy sensors, and collaboration tools are essential to the implementation of the blueprint.
