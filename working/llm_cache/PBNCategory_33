This category of Benenefits describes various methods and strategies that can help prevent the spread of contagious diseases, particularly in green building neighborhoods. The benefits listed include reduced virus lifespan on surfaces, reduction in virus viability on surfaces, antimicrobial surfaces, on contact surfaces, reduced contact with surfaces, reduction of virus survival on surfaces, disinfection of surfaces, reduced viral load on surfaces, and identification of coronavirus-positive environmental surfaces. These benefits are aimed at minimizing the presence and transmission of viruses in the built environment, by eliminating or reducing their viability on surfaces and promoting a clean and sanitary environment. By implementing these measures, individuals in green building neighborhoods can help decrease the risk of infection and contribute to creating safer and healthier communities.
