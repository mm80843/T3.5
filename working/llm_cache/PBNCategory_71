This category of Risks describes various challenges and limitations related to data availability, integrity, sharing, and management. It includes risks such as the lack of mobility data for most cities, limited data availability and sharing, disintegrated and non-interoperable data, insufficient data for analysis, data security and privacy concerns, data quality and reliability issues, challenges with data capture, and fragmented data. These risks highlight the difficulties in accessing and utilizing comprehensive, accurate, and real-time data for informed decision-making, particularly in the context of pandemic management and public health. Additionally, the risks highlight the gaps in data standardization, data formats, and data linkage, as well as the reliance on data mining and machine-learning-based computational approaches. The risks also touch upon the limitations in data collection, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as well as the challenges in accessing historical data and data on settlements. Overall, these risks underline the importance of effective data infrastructure, harmonization, and data-driven approaches in understanding and mitigating contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly within green buildings neighborhoods.
