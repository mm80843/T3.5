* My recommendation is the adoption and implementation of the 'Blueprint' plan, which has been strategically crafted to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases in densely populated green buildings and neighbourhoods. The plan recognizes the specific risks associated with high occupancy architecture and its enclosed air systems' potential to aid pathogenic transmission. By employing a combination of individual health practices, improved ventilation, organizational norms such as cordon sanitaire and physical distancing, and various technology-oriented solutions, the blueprint anticipates and addresses the many ways contagious diseases can spread in such settings. Above all, implementing the blueprint brings considerable benefits such as reducing transmission and infection rates while indirectly curbing financial losses.

* Government bodies, building owners, employers, individuals, and public health authorities can implement the blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks included in the blueprint primarily deal with the numerous modes of disease transmission within various contexts. These include airborne transmission through aerosols and bodily fluids, as well as transmission via close contact in public spaces, gatherings, and buildings, often in poorly ventilated areas. The blueprint also considers the potential surge of transmission after easing interventions and takes into account the economic and social factors that contribute to the spread of infectious diseases.
