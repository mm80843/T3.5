* My first recommendation is immediate implementation of this 'Blueprint'. To put it simply, this blueprint is essentially a guidebook aiming to prevent the spread of contagious diseases within densely populated neighborhoods, like green buildings. It works by recognizing and tackling certain risk factors such as crowding, irregular mobility patterns, or shared common facilities, which possibly contribute to disease transmission. At the heart of it, this blueprint suggests controlling the number of people present in a given space, re-configuring housing units to prevent overcrowding, and enforcing social distancing in public facilities. By complementing this with technology such as nanotechnology, wearable devices, Internet of Things and various monitoring systems, we hope to create a safer, more protected community.

* The stakeholders who are in the best position and have the authority to implement this blueprint can be urban planners, governments, policymakers, and developers.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The blueprint outlines various risks that are associated with dense neighbourhoods. These include disparity in mobility patterns, state policies that do not account for this population density, the physical reality of crowded living conditions, and lack of adequate facilities. It also notes the unique challenges presented by the loss of green spaces and variations in car parking standards. The blueprint further highlights the increased risk of disease spread due to the frequency of contact in workplaces, shops, and during events.
