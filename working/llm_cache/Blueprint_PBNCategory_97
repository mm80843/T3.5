The context of this Blueprint revolves around the potential for the spread and presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems. In concrete terms, it's about how designed infrastructure, specifically in green building neighbourhoods, can contribute to the containment of contagious diseases, particularly SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. This Blueprint has significant relevance due to the high risk of virus transmission through untreated water, particularly in densely populated urban neighbourhoods.

The risks identified within this blueprint focus on multiple facets of SARS-CoV-2 spread through wastewater. It highlights the ease of pandemic virus transmission through wastewater and challenges associated with detecting the virus in such a setting. A lack of standardized methods for assaying environmental samples poses a significant hurdle. The risks go beyond immediate health concerns to the implications of inefficient detection and removal of the virus fragments during wastewater treatment, which can result in broader, more sustained avenues of transmission.

The mitigation measures laid out in this blueprint target the identified risks at multiple levels. Primarily, the enhancement of water treatment processes and the implementation of effective sanitation measures are emphasized, tackling the issue of virus transmission directly. Another mitigation measure involves the improvement of assay sensitivity and the development of standardized protocols for virus detection in environmental samples. This would ensure consistency in data, which is indispensable for monitoring virus activity. The plan also suggests regular testing of wastewater samples to enable prompt control measures. Moreover, the adoption of advanced treatment processes to improve the removal efficiency of the virus' RNA could be instrumental in stemming the spread.

Implementing the mitigation measures laid out in this blueprint offers key benefits. It provides an early warning system for disease outbreaks through regular monitoring of wastewater, enabling prompt response and containment. A real-time snapshot of the virusâ€™s prevalence in the community can be obtained, allowing for a population-wide surveillance system. Ultimately, these measures will facilitate the early detection of COVID-19, thus laying the groundwork for swift, targeted public health interventions. This would result in improved public health safety and potentially save countless lives in the event of future outbreaks.
