* Based on the analysis, I would highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' as a practical solution against the risks highlighted. Its purpose is to address the mental health concerns within green building neighborhoods, brought on by the isolation, anxiety, and fear factors associated with contagious diseases. Mitigation involves improving access to mental health services and fostering social connections. By encouraging self-care practices, we can help instill healthy coping mechanisms in our populations. The use of green spaces and adherence to social distancing rules will also prove beneficial. The beauty of this blueprint is its simplicity; it's grounded in promoting mental health awareness, social connections, and the embracing of nature, all the while adhering to necessary safety precautions.

* Healthcare providers, governments, mental health professionals, and mental health and support organizations are the individuals and groups who can readily implement this blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks targeted in this blueprint are mental health-related, specifically as a result of social isolation, anxiety, fear, and quarantine linked to contagious diseases. The possibility of increased domestic violence, stigmatization, discrimination, and scarcity of mental health resources also fall under these risks. Predominantly, the general population, healthcare workers, building occupants, and residents experience these risks, potentially having long-term impacts on their mental and physical health.
