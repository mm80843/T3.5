This category of Mitigations represents various strategies and technologies that can be implemented to improve indoor air quality and reduce the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green building neighborhoods. These include measures such as the use of air filtration systems, portable room air cleaners, and high-efficiency filters to remove contaminants from the air. Other mitigations involve monitoring and controlling indoor air quality, increasing ventilation rates, and ensuring proper airflow direction. Additionally, there are suggestions to address pollution sources, implement air purification systems, and optimize fresh air supply. The goal is to create a healthier and safer indoor environment by reducing airborne transmission and maintaining good indoor airflow.
