* As an expert in contagious diseases spread in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings neighbourhoods, I strongly recommend implementing 'Blueprint' as a mitigation strategy for potential risks. The Blueprint encompasses a myriad of strategies such as the use of acoustic materials for sound insulation, regulation of noise levels in urban areas, use of IoT and AI technologies, physical barriers for distancing, reinforcement of sanitary measures, and use of blockchain technology for enhanced security. Moreover, it targets improved asset value and prevention of viral transmission as core benefits. In simple terms, it maps the course of preventive action, not only offering a safer, healthier living environment but aiming at the sustainability of green buildings and livelihoods. 

* The blueprint can be implemented by stakeholders such as the government, building owners, and facility managers.

* The risks addressed in the Blueprint range from individual to societal and systemic issues related to contagious diseases spread within infrastructure. They encompass challenges related to individual exposure, interrupted education, cybersecurity threats, privacy breaches, poor indoor air quality, potential disease spread from external sources, and much more. In essence, the Blueprint provides a comprehensive roadmap for combating a wide spectrum of challenges posed by contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods.
