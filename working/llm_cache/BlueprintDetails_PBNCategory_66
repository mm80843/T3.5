* I recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in your green building neighbourhoods. In basic terms, the 'Blueprint' is a set of steps, actions, and technologies aimed at improving the detection, control, and management of contagious diseases within these green environments. It includes methods to enhance contact tracing and diagnostic testing capacities through the use of digital tools, improving symptom monitoring, accelerating the production of accurate testing kits and prioritising research. By following these steps, we can handle any disease outbreak more effectively and maintain the health of the population within green buildings while keeping everyone safe.

* Government authorities, healthcare organisations, and owners of public spaces within green building neighbourhoods can implement the 'Blueprint'.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The 'Blueprint' lists several risks associated with controlling contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods such as difficulties in contact tracing, limited testing capacity, and disruptions in surveillance systems. All these could lead to issues such as incomplete disease detection, misdiagnosis, and ineffective management of disease outbreaks.
