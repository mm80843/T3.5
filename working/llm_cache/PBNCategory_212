This category of Interventions describes the implementation of touchless technologies in green building neighborhoods. These technologies eliminate or reduce the need for physical touch and contact with common surfaces, such as doorknobs, elevator buttons, and light switches. By using motion sensors, voice activation, or smartphone apps, individuals can interact with the building infrastructure without the risk of spreading contagious diseases through direct contact. It is likely that individuals in this list are part of the green building community and have adopted touchless technologies to improve public health and safety in their neighborhoods.
