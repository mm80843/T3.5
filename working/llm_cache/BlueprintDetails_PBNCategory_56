* I recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' to effectively mitigate the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings and densely populated neighbourhoods. In practice, this plan involves adherence to measures such as social distancing and universal precautions, alongside the use of advanced technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. There should be a particular focus on regulation of indoor environments with regards to temperature and humidity levels, so as to reduce the transmission of illnesses such as influenza. Efforts should be made to improve ventilation and air filtration systems in buildings, and to properly disinfect and treat hospital waste and wastewater, to eliminate pathogens. Additionally, public awareness and education campaigns should be rolled out to ensure everyone is informed on how to adhere to safety protocols.

* The stakeholders who can implement the blueprint include individuals, healthcare organisations, governments, and building owners.

* The risk of the 'Blueprint' pertains to the transmission of contagious diseases in infrastructure. It highlights a lack of understanding of disease transmission patterns, inadequate response planning, the ramifications of high population density, and the impact of quarantines and social distancing. Other specific risks include the spread of diseases in crowded spaces, unreliable epidemic modelling and the increased prevalence of diseases like HIV. Finally, the blueprint stresses the need for comprehensive preparedness in tracking and containing outbreaks.
