      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_248 has_ArticleLLMSummary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China and spread quickly. To stop the spread, China took different measures like travel restrictions to limit people\\'s movement. Scientists wanted to understand how these measures affected the spread of COVID-19 in different cities in China. They used data on people\\'s movements and case information to study this. They found that before the restrictions, many cases in other cities had traveled from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. But after the restrictions, the number of cases from Wuhan decreased and the virus spread less. This means that the control measures in China helped to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_273 has_ArticleLLMShortSummary The study aimed to compare the literature on occupant health assessment in buildings with professional opinions and understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on professionals\\' perspectives. A literature review identified a focus on physical and mental well-being, with limited research on social well-being, and an emphasis on indoor air quality and ventilation. Professionals identified physical symptoms like fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders as important, while mental well-being focused on stress, depression, and anxiety. Professionals considered questionnaires as the most important method for assessing occupant health, while physiological/psychometric measurements were less favored. Office buildings were most studied and experienced, indicating a need for research in other building types. Professionals believed that they can influence occupant health and that health should be incorporated as an objective in building design and operation. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced professionals\\' perspectives, with increased focus on ventilation, less dense layouts, touch-free systems, and hands-free controls. Challenges included a lack of understanding, collaboration, proof of return on investment, and data privacy concerns. Future research should address social well-being, quantitative metrics, collaboration, and trade-offs between energy efficiency and health.\n",

      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_2 has_ArticleLLMSummary This text talks about the relationship between housing, health, and social inequality during the Covid-19 pandemic. It explains that the pandemic has led to increases in inequality and health problems, and that housing plays a big role in this. The text also introduces the idea of social harm, which means things that can harm people\\'s health and well-being, like domestic violence or mental health problems. It suggests that home can be a place where these harms occur. The text also mentions research that has been done on these topics, including studies about domestic violence, mental health, and health-harming behaviors like smoking or drinking too much alcohol. The writer concludes by saying that more research is needed on these topics and that a social harm perspective could be useful in understanding and addressing these issues.\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_60 has_ArticleLLMSummary The COVID-19 pandemic showed how interconnected countries are through global value chains (GVCs), which are networks where different countries specialize in producing different parts of a product. While GVCs have many economic benefits, like lower prices and increased productivity, there are also risks and instability involved. Some people suggest that countries should \\\"re-localize\\\" GVCs by producing more things domestically to reduce these risks. However, a recent study by the OECD shows that this might not be the best solution. The study found that if countries re-localize GVCs, they would become less efficient and less able to handle shocks. It would also lead to lower levels of economic activity and income. Instead, governments can work with businesses to improve their readiness for shocks and diversify their supply chains to reduce risk.\n",

This commentary highlights the need to learn from past urban governance experiences and the potential value of urban experimentation in times of crisis. While COVID-19 may not be a completely unique event, it has resulted in global changes and sparked discussions about the lasting impact on urban resilience and sustainability. Lessons from previous public-health emergencies, such as SARS, H1N1, Ebola, and Zika, have highlighted the importance of global and urban governance. The pandemic has emphasized the complexities of contemporary urbanism, with densely populated cities facing challenges in controlling infection. It also exposes inequalities in access to sanitation and housing, both in the Global South and globally. However, cities like New York and Hong Kong have effectively managed high-rise density and social distancing measures, providing examples of potential solutions. The crisis also presents an opportunity for forced experimentation and long-term transformative measures in urban governance, including leveraging crisis-information repositories and health-check apps to drive risk-literate urban citizenry. However, it is crucial to consider the potential for such advancements to further exacerbate urban inequalities. Mutual aid groups and local authorities\\' responses to at-risk groups exemplify the importance of community building and understanding informal governance. City governments are facing significant challenges and limited powers, but temporary measures taken during the pandemic can provide valuable insights for reform.

The study used three types of viruses: respiratory adenovirus, coronavirus (as a surrogate for SARS coronavirus), and the bacteriophage MS2. Aerosols were generated using a Collison nebulizer and exposed to UV-C irradiation in an experimental chamber. The results showed that the MS2 bacteriophage was more resistant to stress during aerosolization and sampling compared to the coronavirus, which was easily inactivated. Adenovirus showed a similar inactivation rate to MS2. The study also found that the UV susceptibility of viral aerosols was higher compared to viruses suspended in liquid. The effect of RH on UV susceptibility was different from that observed previously for bacterial aerosols. High RH did not provide a protective effect, and the UV susceptibility of viral aerosols was higher at higher RH.

The virus spreads rapidly in indoor environments, making proper ventilation and filtration systems crucial to reduce infection risk. However, most existing HVAC systems are not designed for the level of filtration needed to control the virus, leading to extensive retrofits and increased energy consumption. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for rethinking how we control indoor air quality, especially in cold climate environments where energy is primarily used for heating. Personalized indoor controls at the room level and patient scale are being explored to meet the demands of healthcare facilities. \\n\\nWhile outdoor air quality has improved during the pandemic due to reduced economic activities, climate change remains a concern. Heat events and the interaction between extreme heat and ozone pose risks to urban environments and vulnerable populations. The pandemic has also caused shifts in energy demands for the building sector, with increased energy consumption in residential buildings and decreased energy needs for commercial buildings. Continuous monitoring of energy demands and adapting built environment designs based on occupant behaviors are necessary. \\n\\nThe pandemic has exacerbated social equity issues related to indoor environments, as people are forced to spend more time indoors without adequate HVAC systems. Low-income communities face the economic burden of using HVAC systems during the summer season. As extended stay-at-home periods continue, sociotechnical analysis and solutions are needed to address the challenges of climate change, vulnerable communities, and global pandemics.\n",

Nevertheless, there is evidence that treated water contains a small amount of microorganisms. These microorganisms adhere to the side walls of the pipes and form so-called biofilms. The growth of biofilms mainly affects the turbidity, taste, odour and colour of the water and in many cases promotes the degradation of disinfectant residues. On the other hand, several studies have shown that these effects are exacerbated during stagnation.\\nConsidering that during the pandemic many public facilities remained closed for long periods of time, this fact is worrying and a cause for concern, especially when the buildings reopen. This concept involves the use of activated carbon philtres at strategic points in the pipe networks to improve taste and eliminate the risk of contamination, as well as the installation of optical biofilm sensors in the water distribution systems of GBNs to monitor the formation of biofilms.

The study highlights the importance of infectious disease surveillance due to the continued risks posed by communicable diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The drivers of disease emergence include climate change, population increases, and global trade and travel. Current surveillance techniques suffer from limitations such as bias and cost.\\n\\nWBE is proposed as a comprehensive and real-time surveillance technique that can monitor multiple diseases, including rare ones, and provide cost-effective data. WBE involves analyzing chemical and biological compounds, also known as biomarkers, in wastewater to gather information on community health and exposure. Wastewater serves as a pooled urine of a whole population, making it a valuable source of information on disease prevalence. WBE has been successful in monitoring drug consumption and lifestyle choices.\\n\\nThe study suggests that WBE can be expanded to monitor infectious diseases by analyzing biomarkers of pathogenic organisms, inflammation, pharmacological interventions, and antimicrobial resistance in wastewater. The presence of pathogenic DNA/RNA residues, inflammation biomarkers, pharmaceuticals, and antimicrobial resistance genes in wastewater can provide insights into disease prevalence and resistance patterns. However, challenges such as the complexity of the wastewater matrix, population size estimation, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for effective implementation.\\n\\nThe study concludes that WBE has the potential to complement current surveillance systems and provide population-wide surveillance data in real-time. Advancements in extraction techniques, analytical tools, and biomarker discovery are needed to overcome the challenges associated with WBE.

The coated surfaces, supplied by Allied BioScience, were prepared by applying a quaternary ammonium polymer coating to stainless steel coupons. The coating thickness was monitored to ensure even application. The test virus was propagated and assayed in the MRC-5 cell line after three freeze-thaw cycles. The viral stocks were then aliquoted and stored at -80\\260C. The performance of the antimicrobial coating was assessed using the ASTM Method E1153, modified to evaluate the efficacy against human coronavirus 229E. Coated stainless steel coupons were incubated with the virus for a contact time of 120 minutes. The viruses were neutralized and extracted from the surface, and the virus titer was determined by plating on MRC-5 monolayers. The antiviral efficacy of SurfaceWise2\\´42 was also evaluated in liquid form using the ASTM E1052 Standard Test Method. The results showed a reduction of the virus by more than 90% within ten minutes and by more than 99.99% within two hours.

With major cities under lockdown, smart city technologies focused on efficiency and traffic management are no longer a priority. Instead, cities are focusing on enforcing lockdown measures, promoting social distancing, and ensuring the availability of essential supplies. The deployment of smart city technologies is expected to be delayed until some level of normality is restored, which may take several months or even years, especially if many workers continue to work from home. The pandemic has also led to increased surveillance and monitoring of individuals, with governments using mobile phone tracking to track the spread of the virus and enforce self-isolation. While such surveillance raises civil-liberty concerns, it also opens up possibilities for data provision into smart cities to optimize transport, reduce crime, and understand people\\'s movement during unusual situations. However, careful consideration of personal data security and sharing is essential to avoid abuse. Smart city technologies can also play a significant role in healthcare by tracking patient numbers, predicting hospital capacity, and optimizing supply chains for essential medical equipment. In the long term, cities may experience changes such as restrictions on crowding in public transport, a decrease in office workers, increased sanitation monitoring, and the development of well-documented procedures to respond to future pandemics.\n",

Under these conditions, standing and untreated water may no longer be potable or used for domestic or commercial purposes due to the growth of various pathogens and the depletion of disinfectants. In addition, changes in water chemistry can increase corrosion and leaching of metals such as lead and cause the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products. In this case, preventive measures must be taken to allow safe resumption of operation after a prolonged period of stagnation.\\nThis BP describes a general procedure for the quality of drinking water in buildings before they are reopened in order to increase the resilience of the drinking water network, which includes the following steps: \\n1) Inspection of the components of the water system, including the sources, the treatment plant, the distribution pipes and the distribution tanks (if applicable). It is advisable to contact the water utility to clarify the coordination of maintenance work.\\n2) Check all supply and consumption spilters and water softeners.\\n3) Flush the distribution system and all other relevant system components.

      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_152 has_ArticleLLMShortSummary This editorial discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cities and the implications for future urban development. The implementation of social distancing measures has altered the use and nature of workspaces, schools, and leisure spaces, prompting discussions about the future of land-use planning and urban design. The pandemic has also influenced the role of the home as a hub for domestic, caring, and professional activities, raising questions about the future of domestic architecture and neighborhood design. As restrictions are easing, public spaces have become focal points for urban life, highlighting the potential future development of open-air cities. There is a debate about the compatibility of pandemic-proof cities with high-density buildings and public transport networks. The growth in medical activities, such as testing, vaccinations, and isolation, has led to the creation of new typologies, including mass vaccination centers and pop-up hospitals, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in urban planning. The historical context of infectious disease outbreaks, such as cholera, plague, and influenza, is explored, highlighting the role of planning in responding to public health threats. The special issue aims to examine how planning has constructed the challenge of epidemics and developed strategies to contain and treat them. The interplay of various factors, such as environmental, social, and cultural, shape the emergence and spread of diseases. The papers in this special issue focus on specific epidemics throughout history and their impact on urban planning. Topics include the role of planning in combating cholera and yellow fever in Buenos Aires, the impact of malaria on military cantonments in British colonial India, the response to the Spanish influenza pandemic in Bombay, and the influence of tuberculosis on town planning in South Australia. Other papers discuss the effects of hypochondriac fears in planning in British Africa, the role of epidemics in the development of Madrid\\'s urban governance, the transformation of Dublin\\'s food markets in response to disease spread, and the geopolitical dimensions of COVID-19 in Jerusalem, Phnom Penh, and Toronto. The papers underscore the contingency of urban planning on medical theory and knowledge, and the potential for planning interventions to exacerbate social inequalities. They highlight the need for future urban planning to consider political contexts and their impacts on health outcomes.\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_152 has_ArticleLLMSummary The coronavirus pandemic has made people think about how cities can be designed in the future to prevent the spread of diseases. Measures like social distancing have changed the way we use public spaces and buildings. During lockdowns, people had to stay inside their homes, but now that restrictions are easing, public spaces are becoming important again. People are discussing whether densely populated cities are a good idea for preventing pandemics. There are also examples of how cities have adapted to deal with disease outbreaks in the past, like building hospitals and vaccination centers. Overall, it\\'s important to learn from history and make sure that cities are designed in ways that keep people healthy and safe.\n",

Scientists wanted to see how these viruses can stay in the air and on different surfaces. They found that both viruses can stay in the air for about 3 hours, and they can stay on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours. However, they don\\'t last very long on copper and cardboard surfaces. The viruses also become less powerful over time and their strength decreases. Overall, both viruses behave pretty similarly and their differences are because of other factors, not how long they can stay in the air or on surfaces.\n",

Intelligent entrances and exits (e.g. doors that only open when people are moving in the right direction) or badge controls are efficient measures to avoid unwanted flows of people in closed areas such as buildings;\n",
      "* Owlready * Adding relation pbn_t3_5.PBN__Article_198 has_ArticleLLMSummary During the COVID-19 pandemic, people in Buenos Aires City were told to stay at home and could only go out for essential reasons. This meant that they couldn\\'t visit their favorite parks and green spaces. As a result, there was a decrease in the number of people visiting urban green spaces during the strict confinement period. But when restrictions were eased, people started visiting the parks again, especially to exercise and meet up with friends and family. The study also found that people who lived near parks were more likely to visit them.
