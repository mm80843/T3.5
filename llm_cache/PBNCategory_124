This category of Mitigations describes the various measures and strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, specifically in green buildings neighbourhoods. These measures include the implementation of quarantine, social distancing, and isolation measures, both at home and in designated facilities. The goal is to prevent the transmission of the disease by restricting the movement of confirmed cases, high-risk individuals, and those who have come into contact with infected individuals. Compliance with quarantine measures, monitoring of quarantined individuals, and providing support in terms of mental health, accurate information, and social support during quarantine are also important aspects of these mitigation strategies. Additionally, the category highlights the need for establishing protocols, expanding telehealth services, and educating the public about the importance of quarantine, social distancing, and travel restrictions. The design and infrastructure of quarantine facilities are also emphasized, with suggestions such as separate air cycles for communal and private spaces, enhanced ventilation, and strict protocols. Overall, these mitigations aim to ensure an efficient public health response, limit the spread of contagious diseases, and protect the well-being of individuals in green buildings neighbourhoods.
