* As an expert in the field, I recommend the practical implementation of the 'Blueprint' strategy. This strategy aims to address potential contagious disease spread in public and green spaces, residences, and shared areas. It recommends steps such as enforcing physical distancing measures in buildings and public spaces, providing better access to green areas, and integrating outdoor spaces into residential and building designs. This also includes enforcing stricter maintenance and cleaning procedures in public areas. One simple and key part of this initiative is the idea of creating more balanced access to outdoor spaces for every resident. Implementing this blueprint would reduce the risk of contagious diseases spreading and improve overall public health.
* Anyone directly involved in the planning, development, and management of indoor and outdoor spaces can implement this blueprint. This group includes professionals like urban planners, local governments, building owners, architects, and facility managers.
* 'Neighbourhood'
* The risks identified in this blueprint are primarily linked with health and wellness as a direct outcome of the use, behaviour and design of our shared public spaces. These range from the danger of overcrowding in public spaces and buildings, lack of access to green areas, inadequate living conditions in residences, inappropriate conditions in office spaces, to many other interrelated risks. The overarching issue is the significant impact that these risks can have on the public, in particular, on mental health and on the spread of contagious diseases.
