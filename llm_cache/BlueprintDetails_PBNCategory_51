* I strongly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint', as it offers a strategic approach to mitigate a variety of risks related to diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. These risks include domestic violence, virus spread, new variants, extreme events, and vulnerabilities of certain populations. By maintaining transparency and objectivity in evidence generation and communication, combatting misinformation, and building trust through consistent and reliable delivery of evidence, 'Blueprint' enhances support services for victims, raises awareness, and strengthens legal and policy frameworks. It also anticipates pandemic impacts and measures their effect on areas of interest. Moreover, 'Blueprint' entails designing buildings with passive strategies and multiple bathrooms for emergencies.

* Government entities, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies are the stakeholders who can effectively implement 'Blueprint'.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks detailed in 'Blueprint' primarily concern certain societal issues and the virus's spread in green building neighbourhoods. The blueprint lists risks of increased domestic violence, limited capacity of violence services, financial strain, and lack of reliable data on violence during the pandemic. It also details risks associated with the virus's spread, identification of new variants, and its geographic distribution. In addition, the blueprint includes risks linked to extreme weather events and black swan events, as well as the risk associated with population movements and exposure to the virus. Another highlight of the blueprint is detailing vulnerabilities in the system, including the lack of community-level vector control capacity and passive survivability.
