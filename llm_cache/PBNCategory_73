This category of Risks describes various aspects related to the spread and transmission of contagious viruses, with a specific focus on respiratory viruses such as the coronavirus. It encompasses the need for standardized representation of coronavirus knowledge, the strain on health services caused by respiratory viruses, and the potential for airborne transmission of these viruses through inhalation of viral particles. The Risks also highlight the risks associated with virus transmission in the built environment, including the spread of viruses on surfaces and through close contact. Factors such as high humidity and physical contact between occupants are identified as increasing the risk of virus transmission. Other Risks touch on the origin and variability of viruses, the survival of viruses outside the host, and limited availability and efficacy of antiviral treatments. Additionally, the Risks address the impact of cleaning practices on virus spread and the inactivation of viruses through various means such as biocidal agents, far-UVC light, and humidity. The category also covers uncertainties regarding viral shedding routes, the presence of viruses in wastewater, and the potential spread of viruses through vertical shafts. Finally, the degradation of viral signal in storage is noted as a potential risk.
