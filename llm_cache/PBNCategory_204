This category of Interventions describes measures that focus on controlling airflows in order to prevent the spread of contagious diseases within green building neighbourhoods. These interventions include ensuring the airtightness of buildings to minimize the infiltration of outside air and the potential entry of contaminants. Additionally, they involve maintaining negative pressure in certain spaces, such as quarantine or isolation rooms, to prevent contaminated air from recirculating and infecting others. By implementing these interventions, individuals within the green building neighbourhood can effectively minimize the transmission of contagious diseases through the control of airflows.
