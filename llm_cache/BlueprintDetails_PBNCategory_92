* I highly recommend the implementation of the "Blueprint" in practice to mitigate the risk of virus spread in green building neighbourhoods. This strategic plan involves both the adoption of smart technologies and modifications to building design and management, effectively reducing the chances of viral transmission. Increased use of touchless technologies and self-cleaning spaces, alongside more traditional means of infection control like optimal ventilation, form part of the approach. In addition, the adoption of anti-microbial materials and regular air quality monitoring further contribute to creating a safer environment. Therefore, this blueprint provides a comprehensive set of measures designed to tackle ongoing and future public health challenges whilst ensuring the comfort and convenience of residents.

* Building management and facilities are ideally suited to implement the blueprint.

* The risks listed in the blueprint span from direct health threats such as potential virus propagation (Pvp1-Pvp6) to those related to personal comfort and provision of local services (Pc1-Pc4, Lc1, Lc2). Additionally, the blueprint identifies risks tied to environmental factors such as water and air quality and contamination (Aq1-Aq4, Wq1-Wq2, Wc1-Wc2), emphasizing that proper stewardship of shared resources and maintenance of clean, healthy environments are paramount for well-being and disease prevention.
