This category of Mitigations describes a wide range of technologies and strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods. These include the adoption and utilization of remote work technologies, contact tracing and monitoring technology, 5G cellular technology, ontologies, molecular technologies, digital tools and technologies, emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, IoT, and virtual reality, smart building and smart city technologies, touchless and contactless technologies, nanotechnology, lab-on-a-chip technologies, UV-based technologies, digital transformation technologies, and industry 4.0 technologies. These technologies enhance communication, improve data storage and analysis, enable remote work, facilitate contact tracing, and promote a touchless and contactless environment. The implementation of these technologies can significantly reduce the transmission of contagious diseases and contribute to the overall safety and health of individuals in the described group.
