* I highly recommend the implementation of this blueprint as a mitigation strategy against hygiene, sanitation, and water-related risks in green-building environments. The blueprint provides a comprehensive guide to increase cleaning frequency and provide adequate cleaning supplies. It also emphasizes the need to improve sanitation infrastructure, promote hygiene education, and secure access to clean water sources. Additionally, it encourages the use of regular hygiene reminders and ensures there are sufficient hand sanitizers and cleaning supplies available. The aim of this blueprint is to create healthier green building neighbourhoods and reduce the potential for the spread of contagious diseases.

* The implementation of the blueprint can be done by key stakeholders such as building owners, facility managers, public health agencies, and local governments.

* 'Building'

* The risks identified in the blueprint center around inadequate sanitation conditions, and poor hygiene practices due to lack of access to clean water and sanitation systems. These risks threaten the health and safety of building occupants, visitors, employees, healthcare workers, and in extension, the general population. Without proper handling, these risks may lead to the spread of various contagious diseases in the green buildings communities.
