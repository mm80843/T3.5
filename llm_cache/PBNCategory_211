This category of Interventions describes the use of cleaning technologies, specifically robots, in infrastructure. These robots are designed to perform cleaning tasks, such as sweeping, mopping, and vacuuming, autonomously. They are equipped with sensors and intelligent algorithms that enable them to navigate through the environment, detect and avoid obstacles, and efficiently clean various surfaces. By utilizing cleaning technologies like robots, individuals can reduce the need for manual labor and ensure a consistent and thorough cleaning process in green buildings neighborhoods.
