This category of Enablers includes air sensors, which are devices used to monitor and measure air quality in buildings or neighborhoods. These sensors are designed to detect and measure pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other harmful substances. By providing real-time data on air quality, they enable individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being, as well as contribute to the identification and mitigation of potential health risks associated with poor air quality.
