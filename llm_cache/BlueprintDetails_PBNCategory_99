* The Blueprint is a strategic toolkit designed as an effective defense against the propagation of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. The implementation of the Blueprint involves enhancing thorough testing and reporting systems, fortifying active surveillance mechanisms for asymptomatic cases, extending testing capacities, and developing unconventional surveillance methods. Essentially, the goal is to augment system resilience, diversify dependencies, and construct comprehensive backup systems. This approach, coupled with efficient communication channels between healthcare providers and public health authorities, can contribute significantly to containing disease spread in such settings.
 
* The main entities empowered to implement this Blueprint are Healthcare organizations, Critical infrastructure operators, Businesses, Public health authorities, and Government agencies.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks outlined in the Blueprint primarily pertain to the heightened potential for disease spread in interconnected communities like green building neighbourhoods. These risks include cascading disruptions where one incident sets off a chain of further disruptions, challenges in timely case identification and handling, and the reality of a significant number of undetected cases, including asymptomatic ones. The latter contributes to insufficient surveillance and containment efforts, under-recording of cases, and uncertainties regarding the duration and effectiveness of immunity after infection and recovery.
