* The blueprint, in essence, aims to enhance urban green spaces to mitigate potential contagious disease risks, improve health, and sustain urban ecosystems. Implementing it involves strategies such as promoting indoor gardening, integrating green spaces into healthcare facilities, and increasing awareness about the advantages of green roofs. It also necessitates the provision of financial incentives for the installation of green roofs and development of cost-effective maintenance plans. Gender-specific research on the benefits of green spaces to devise targeted interventions is an important part of this plan. 

* The blueprint can be implemented by a range of stakeholders including urban planners, developers, city governments, community organizations, and local governments.

* The blueprint identifies a variety of risks related to urban green spaces, including loss of biodiversity, reduced access during lockdowns, and higher installation and maintenance costs. It also highlights the perceived risks of accessing these spaces amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, inequality in distribution, and less visitation. It underscores the need for improved management of such spaces, boosting public awareness and understanding of their benefits, and promoting initiatives like the European Green Deal.
