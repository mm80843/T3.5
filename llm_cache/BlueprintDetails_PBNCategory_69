* The 'Blueprint' is created to handle the risks related to the spread and impact of contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. The mitigation strategy revolves around controlling how people move, interact, and use shared space, particularly in densely populated areas. Implementation involves revising layouts using floor markings for effective social distancing, encouraging travel restrictions, and installing advanced technologies like HVAC systems and air purifiers for good air quality. Also, utilizing wearable devices for health monitoring and leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for better space management is crucial. Moreover, making sure people are aware and educated about the necessary precautionary measures is an essential part of the blueprint.

* The blueprint can be implemented by multiple stakeholders including individuals, governments, healthcare organizations and institutions.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks covered in the blueprint primarily revolve around the extensive and complex issues of the spread and impact of contagious diseases. This includes risks not just directly related to pathogen transmission in public housing, streets, buildings and specific environments (like healthcare and construction), but also includes the broader impacts like exacerbating inequalities, instilling fear, stigma, and mental health challenges. The risks also highlight challenges due to lack of knowledge, reliable data, medication, and vaccines. The blueprint addresses these multifaceted risks with practical mitigation measures.
