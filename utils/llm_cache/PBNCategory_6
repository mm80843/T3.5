This category of Benenefits describes the various ways in which green buildings and their infrastructure contribute to the prevention and reduction of contagious diseases. These benefits include the correlation between RNA concentration and prevalence, which helps in monitoring and predicting the spread of diseases. The dilution effect and natural greywater treatment help in effectively diluting and treating contaminants. The inactivation of microorganisms in high-risk spaces, as well as the clean and constant water supply, reduce the risk of contamination. The reduction of microbial dispersion, bacterial community variation, and surface contamination further contribute to preventing the spread of diseases. The efficient use and treatment of water, as well as the optimization of water management, reduce the risk of faecal contamination, leaks, and microbial bioaerosols. The proper waste disposal and recycling also play a crucial role in preventing cross-contamination and maintaining a hygienic environment. Overall, these benefits highlight the significant impact of green buildings in reducing the risk and spread of contagious diseases.
