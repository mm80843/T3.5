* To implement the blueprint in practice involves first, introducing UV-based technologies into ventilation systems to destroy airborne pathogens. Second, existing ventilation rates and airflow need to be increased while integrated with filtration and air purification systems. Third, a regular maintenance schedule must be established for HVAC systems. Fourth, more natural ventilation through control systems for windows and air vents and by increasing air circulation is recommended. In essence, this strategy revolves around improving air quality and reducing respiratory risks through robust ventilation practices.

* The blueprint can be implemented by stakeholders including facility managers, building owners, architects, and engineers who have the necessary knowledge and technical abilities to establish and maintain efficient ventilation systems.

* Building

* The risks in the blueprint are associated with poor air quality due to inadequate ventilation in various settings such as hospitals, public buildings, and indoor spaces. These include inefficient ventilation systems, increased likelihood of respiratory illnesses, and shortages in ICU resources like beds and ventilators. Strategies to mitigate these risks center around improving ventilation systems and air quality to enhance respiratory health and reduce strain on healthcare facilities.
