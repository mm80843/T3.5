This category of Stakeholders represents a wide range of groups and individuals who may be at higher risk or face social and economic disadvantages. They include community groups, advocacy groups, organizations promoting gender equality, minorities, indigenous groups, cultural and social groups, individuals in socially disadvantaged areas, and individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. These Stakeholders may also include high-risk groups, specific at-risk groups, marginalized groups, vulnerable groups (including women), and individuals from stigmatized groups. Additionally, it encompasses society as a whole, social media users, individuals with limited social connections, and individuals participating in social gatherings. The common factor among these Stakeholders is their potential vulnerability or disadvantage in the context of contagious diseases and the spread of infections in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods.
