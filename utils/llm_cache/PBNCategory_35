This category of Benenefits describes the various ways in which diseases are prevented and controlled, particularly in relation to transmission. It includes measures such as reducing disease transmission, both indirect and direct, as well as decreasing the risk of airborne and aerosol transmission. The benefits also encompass interrupting and suppressing the spread of diseases, improving understanding of disease transmission, and enhancing protection against transmission. Additionally, this category highlights the prevention of specific types of transmission, such as droplet and vertical transmission. Apart from disease-related transmission, there is also a focus on reducing noise transmission in this list.
