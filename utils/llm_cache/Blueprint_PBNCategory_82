* The 'Blueprint' is a strategic response plan devised to address the potential threat of infectious diseases, particularly in the context of densely populated green buildings and neighbourhoods. These modern architectural settings, designed with the goal of sustainability in mind, can become a conduit for pathogens to spread faster, primarily due to their high occupancy and closed-circuit air systems. To combat these emerging health risks associated with innovative urban living models, a comprehensive plan designed as a blueprint has been developed.

* The risk addressed in this blueprint focusses specifically on the numerous modes of pathogen transmission in various settings. This encompasses risks associated with airborne transmission through aerosols, bodily fluids, or via close contact. Transmission is often heightened in public spaces, buildings, poorly ventilated rooms and among vulnerable sections of the population such as healthcare workers and occupants of crowded spaces. The blueprint also highlights potential spikes after the relaxation of intervention measures and the crucial role of economic considerations and social circumstances in these situations.

* Mitigation measures detailed in the blueprint include individual protective practices such as wearing face masks, maintaining physical distance, respiratory hygiene measures, and rapid isolation protocols. At an organizational level, recommendations include enhacing ventilation, imposing physical distancing procedures, implementing cordon sanitaire, and setting up physical barriers as and when necessary. Technology-oriented solutions such as IoT, wearable devices, floor markings, internet-based communication, and technology-enabled monitoring systems form a significant part of the mitigation plan.

* The implementation of the blueprint promises a myriad of benefits. Besides the core objective of reducing the rate of transmission and infection risk, its strategic measures indirectly contribute to a reduction in financial losses. The enhanced use of technology for monitoring and mitigating health threats can potentially streamline processes and improve efficiency in managing health risks in built environments. This blueprint forms an essential component in ensuring the sustainability and safety of green buildings and neighbourhoods, proving invaluable in promoting public health.
