This category of Risks describes a wide range of challenges and issues related to contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green building neighborhoods. These risks include global mobility, challenges in contact tracing, technological limitations and dependencies, challenges with quarantining, lack of interoperability among ontologies, lack of consensus on interoperability standards, reduction of socialization, resistance to new materials, lack of communication and coordination, high costs and complexity, insufficient resource allocation, unpreparedness for future pandemics, exclusion from government support programs, impact on developing countries, limited infrastructure, inadequate global preparedness for pandemics, increased workload and capacity overload, maintenance of essential services, improper system configuration and settings, and inadequate global coordination. Other risks involve limited understanding of complex conservation challenges, ineffective reachability to patients, reliance on technology and digital platforms, complexity and lack of interoperability in electronic health record systems, lack of standardized measurement protocols for indoor environmental quality, resource limitations in low- and middle-income countries, difficulties in compliance with regulations, exclusion of startups and delayed support, limited recognition and space in apartments, inadequate vector control operations, inefficient space utilization, fragmentation of efforts, limited capacity and dependence on international researchers, limited capacity for education and compliance, insufficient design guidelines and technical installations, inequitable distribution of resources, resistance to using new systems, shortage of personal protective equipment, logistics inefficiency, and poor solubility and processing of graphene materials. Additionally, this category of Risks includes legal and regulatory challenges, publication bias, lack of clear criteria and guidelines for various activities, displacement and strain on resources, network congestion and poor quality of service, inefficient integration and analysis, and increased costs of disinfection byproducts and chemical costs.
