This category of Benenefits describes the various advantages associated with reduced risk and protection against vector-borne and infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted by ticks, mosquitoes, and other vectors. These benefits include a decreased risk of tick-borne diseases and west Nile infection, as well as a reduction in mosquito breeding and human-mosquito contact. Additionally, this category encompasses protection from infectious diseases, including respiratory illnesses and tuberculosis, and highlights the role of biodiversity as a disease reservoir. It also emphasizes the lower vulnerability to disease and decreased risk of mosquito intrusion and breeding, ultimately resulting in a reduced risk of mosquito-borne infections.
