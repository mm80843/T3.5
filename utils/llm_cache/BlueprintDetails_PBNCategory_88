* The 'Blueprint' is a comprehensive mitigation strategy designed to minimize the environmental and climatic risks associated with green buildings and neighbourhoods. The implementation involves instituting energy-saving measures, maintaining high ventilation rates, promoting sustainable and alternative energy sources, and leveraging various technologies such as advanced HVAC systems, occupancy sensors and solar chargers. These technical implementations aim to foster optimal energy use and reduction, thereby ensuring reduced energy consumption, improved living conditions, and better financial feasibility for green infrastructures.

* The 'Blueprint' can be successfully implemented by stakeholders such as building owners, facility managers, individuals, policymakers, and energy managers.

* 'Building'

* The risks listed in the 'Blueprint' cover climate change and environmental damage risks pertinent to green buildings and neighbourhoods. These include, but aren't limited to, reliance on fossil fuels, inefficient energy usage, urban overheating, inadequate HVAC systems, energy poverty, and insufficient adoption of clean energy technologies. The risks also encompass challenges in global climate diplomacy, the perception of climate change as a distant threat, and inadequate funding for climate action. The underlying aim of the 'Blueprint' is to address all these concerns and improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of green buildings and neighbourhoods.
