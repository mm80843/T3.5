* The first recommendation is to implement the blueprint in practice. The plan addresses the risk of contagious diseases in green neighborhoods by focusing on measures like strengthening wildlife trade regulations, enhancing law enforcement efforts, educating the public on conservation, and controlling vectors using natural methods and environment-friendly planning. Green areas are kept free from breeding spots for disease vectors, while innovative measures control disease spread. The community is kept informed and educated about preventing mosquito infestation and overpopulation. Climate change mitigation measures are enforced to minimize mosquito-breeding grounds.

* Public health authorities, city and government officials, public health agencies and vector control agencies can implement this blueprint. 

* Building 

* The blueprint addresses risks like wildlife conservation, infections from ticks and mosquitoes, climate change effects on disease spread, and lack of sanitation and hygiene in green buildings. It tackles the increase of pests and vectors in urban areas and diseases spread by them. Moreover, it covers the risks posed by invasive mosquito species and the implications of dam constructions on human schistosomiasis prevalence. The blueprint also accounts for the stagnant water and traditional materials in green buildings that attract mosquitoes and intensify disease transmission.
