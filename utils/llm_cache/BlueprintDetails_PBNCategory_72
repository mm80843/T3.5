* The Blueprint is a strategy designed to manage and mitigate risks related to the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These risks pertain to aspects such as global mobility, contact tracing, technological limitations, quarantining, and more. To implement this blueprint, one needs to follow a set of steps. First, it is essential to adopt common protocols and interoperability standards to ensure a unified approach. Next, building an ontology (a representation of knowledge in a specific domain) helps in managing data and information related to diseases. It's also important to develop contingency plans and backup systems, enhance cybersecurity measures, and diversify communication channels and platforms to address challenges effectively.

* The stakeholders who can implement this blueprint include researchers, government bodies, ontology developers, and manufacturers who have the technical knowledge, resources, and capacity to develop and enforce these strategies.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks outlined in this blueprint encompass a range of challenges relating to the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These include difficulties in tracing contacts due to global mobility, technological limitations and dependencies, challenges in quarantining individuals, lack of interoperability among ontologies, resistance to new materials, and lack of communication and coordination, among others. Additionally, factors such as high costs, complexity, insufficient resource allocation, and unpreparedness for pandemics also contribute to these risks.
