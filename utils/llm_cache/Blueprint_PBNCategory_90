* The 'Blueprint' pertains to the management and mitigation of contagious diseases spread in infrastructure, especially focusing on green buildings and healthcare facilities. Green buildings have increasingly become popular for their sustainability benefits. However, they also present unique challenges regarding the control of infectious diseases due to their specific construction and operational characteristics. In the backdrop of ongoing global health threats like antimicrobial resistance and other infectious ailments, this Blueprint is deemed essential in not only addressing these risks but also in creating safer and healthier built environments. 

* Risks outlined in the Blueprint highlight a spectrum of issues that contribute to the spread of infectious diseases within these types of buildings. Hospitals, in particular, appear to be hotspots due to antimicrobial resistance, ineffective disinfection technologies, insufficient sanitization protocols, and inadequate decontamination measures, among others. Besides healthcare workers who are directly at risk, the public, environmental agencies, water authorities, building occupants, and cleaning staff are among the individuals and groups that could be impacted. Moreover, the poor disposal of hospital wastes, especially pharmaceutical and chemical wastes, add another prominent layer of environmental and public health concern.

* In facing these risks, the Blueprint suggests mitigation measures including regular cleaning and disinfection protocols, appropriate disposal and disinfection of hospital wastes, and developing and implementing proper cleaning and sanitation strategies and resources. Stakeholders such as hospital management, government bodies, environmental agencies, facility managers, and cleaning staff can contribute significantly in rolling out these mitigation measures. The role of technology in this process, whether it's PCR techniques, environmental surveillance, waste management or UV light disinfection, remains paramount in ensuring effective actions towards these measures.

* The benefits of implementation of these measures are as explicit as they are far-reaching. Key among these benefits is the reduction in infection risk, a crucial aspect in healthcare environments and green buildings, where the potential for spread is considerable. By implementing technologically advanced disinfection and waste management measures, not only can the potential for human contact, and thus the spread of diseases, be lessened, but areas can also be sanitized in real time for disease monitoring. This could lead to a healthier hospital staff, patients, building occupants and a cleaner environment.
