* The blueprint at hand is fundamentally designed to mitigate the risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. In the context of urban planning and infrastructure, green buildings represent an innovative approach to environmentally sustainable construction. Primarily populated by tick and mosquito vectors, such areas are increasingly being perceived as potential hotspots for disease transmission, especially those carried by these vector species. The risks and threats in question span across climate variability, extreme weather events, inadequate sanitation, and conservation of wildlife. 

* Complications arising from the increased occurrence of ticks and mosquitoes in urban areas, invasive mosquito species, urban pests, and disease vectors constitute core risks targeted by this blueprint. The ramifications these pose encapsulate a variety of issues, including the impact of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases, increased mosquito intrusion and breeding, and the spread of diseases such as West Nile Virus due to urban greening. It also acknowledges concerns tied to zoonotic diseases from urban rats and the higher prevalence of human schistosomiasis due to dam constructions. Furthermore, there are the risks associated with stagnant water and traditional materials in green buildings that can attract mosquitoes, thereby intensifying the potential for disease transmission.

* Key mitigation measures proposed in this blueprint range from strengthening wildlife trade regulations, enhancing law enforcement efforts, raising public awareness on wildlife conservation, and implementing ecosystem-based approaches to control vectors. The measures also include novel control methods, improvements to environmental hygiene, enhancements to urban planning strategies, water circulation and aeration, and mosquito control measures. Additionally, increasing public education on mosquito prevention and climate change mitigation measures to reduce mosquito breeding sites form essential parts of the mitigation measures. The blueprint encourages diversified stakeholders (public health authorities, city governments, governments, public health agencies, vector control agencies) to carry out these measures to curb the risks.

* The blueprint's implementation benefits comprise of marked increases in public awareness and compliance with preventive measures, in tandem with a significant rise in public knowledge. By deploying this strategy, stakeholders can achieve a substantial decrement in disease transmission rates. The blueprint also highlights several applicable technologies, including green space design, management, media, advertising, educational materials, green roofs, insecticide-treated screens, and geographical information systems. It thus serves as a comprehensive solution to combat and prevent the spread of contagious diseases prevalent in green-building neighborhoods.
