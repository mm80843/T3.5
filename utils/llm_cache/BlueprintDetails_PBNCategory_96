* I strongly recommend implementing 'Blueprint,' a comprehensive mitigation strategy against various risks associated with UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation) systems. 'Blueprint' essentially revolves around creating efficient dose-response relationship models for UVGI to optimize their functioning. It also recommends educating service personnel and building occupants about the importance of adhering to proper usage and maintenance protocols. Moreover, it endorses the use of supplementary methods for disinfection and advocates for more extensive research into the efficacy of UVGI in preventing diseases. Finally, the 'Blueprint' encourages the exploration of relative humidity and UV susceptibility relationship â€“ a valuable insight for environments with varying humidity levels.

* The 'Blueprint' can be implemented by a collaboration of stakeholders, including building owners, facility managers, researchers, designers, and governmental regulators.

* The risks involved in 'Blueprint' primarily pertain to potential occupational exposure to contagious diseases and the decreased effectiveness of UVGI systems in high humidity. Some of these risks revolve around the lack of standardized protocols for testing the effectiveness of UVGI systems, and the need for stringent adherence to proper usage and maintenance guidelines. Other concerns include potential health risks, limited awareness of germicidal UV technology, the damaging effects of inadequately shielded UV-C light on humans, and the cost and inconvenience of mask filters in smart face masks.
