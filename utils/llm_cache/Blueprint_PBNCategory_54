* The context surrounding this blueprint focuses on social distancing and its related risks and mitigations in the realm of green buildings and infrastructure. Central to this is the interplay between infrastructure, technology, and human factors as they influence the spread of contagious diseases. The understanding of how risks play out and different strategies to mitigate them can finally lead to a reduction in the spread of these diseases. 

* A key aspect of tackling infectious diseases in buildings and related environments is managing the associated risks. Principal among these is the difficulty in consistently applying and enforcing social distancing measures. Other issues include inadequate infrastructure for isolation, negative psychological effects resulting from isolation, inequalities in social and economic settings, and potentially negative perceptions associated with particular residents. All of these factors can potentially contribute to increasing the risk and speed of disease spread, accentuating the need for careful management and targeted mitigation strategies.

* A key strategy enshrined in this blueprint involves stringent social distancing protocols, including the control of workspaces and breaks and limits on worker congestion. The plan also advocates for the increasing use of virtual communication and digital technologies to facilitate social interaction and mitigate the psychological toll of isolation. It emphasizes fostering community engagement and social support networks, including access to mental health resources for those suffering from loneliness due to the pandemic's restrictions. Moreover, the enhancement of physical spaces, installation of physical barriers, usage of internet-based communication tools, application of technology-enabled monitoring systems, and even the innovative use of Internet of Things(IoT) are tangible mitigation measures that can be employed to this end.

* The benefits of deploying the mitigation measures outlined in the blueprint are numerous. The most significant advantage is the reduction of disease transmission rates, leading to better public health outcomes overall. The blueprint also promises benefits in the form of increased productivity as disruptions due to illness are minimized. The decrease in virus transmission can lead to a more robust workforce, minimizing disruptions and optimizing operations despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. These benefits highlight the essential nature and overall positive effect of adopting the suggested blueprint in green buildings and neighbourhoods.
