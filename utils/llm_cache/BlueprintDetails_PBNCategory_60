* The Blueprint presents a mitigation strategy for managing the risks related to contagions in green building neighbourhoods. The strategic plan focuses on strengthening the healthcare facilitiesâ€™ infrastructure, establishing additional capacity during outbreaks, utilising telemedicine potential, and ensuring sufficient medical supplies. The implementation process involves relevant stakeholders, emphasizes on collaboration between government bodies, healthcare organisations and professionals, and leverages technological advancements. The elementary step is to assess current capacities and vulnerabilities and then deploy investment and resource allocation accordingly for the upgrade of healthcare infrastructure.

* The key stakeholders who can implement the blueprint and benefit from it primarily include healthcare organisations, government bodies, healthcare providers and institutions with the supporting roles of technology service providers.

* 'Neighbourhood' is the impact scale of the blueprint as it considers contagious diseases primarily within the context of green buildings in areas sharing common resources.

* The risks outlined in the blueprint primarily focus on the failure of healthcare systems due to overloading, lack of healthcare personnel, medication and equipment. Limited accessibility of healthcare services, financial implications due to resource burden, rise in healthcare disparities and inequality are vital issues. On top of these, disruptions of clinical services and inadequate healthcare responses further aggravate the situation, emphasising the need for a comprehensive mitigation blueprint.
