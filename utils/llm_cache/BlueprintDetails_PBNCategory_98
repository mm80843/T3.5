* Implementing the Blueprint is an important strategic measure to ensure the safety and well-being of people in green building neighbourhoods, especially given the potential for disease spread. Basically, the Blueprint recommends increased production and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE), efficient lighting systems reducing unnecessary energy use, improved safety protocols, and enhanced education and communication about these measures. Furthermore, it encourages the use of multiple advanced technologies, such as surveillance systems and heat treatment, to support these precautions. With these measures in place, the green building neighbourhoods would be better equipped to prevent and combat the spread of contagious diseases.

* The Blueprint can be implemented by a range of stakeholders involved in the management and use of green buildings. Key stakeholders include healthcare organisations, manufacturers of PPE, facility management teams, government bodies, and staff trainers.

* 'Neighbourhood' 

* As outlined in the Blueprint, the risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods range from the misuse and insufficient supply of PPE to poor adherence to safety protocols, lack of awareness, inadequate protection for staff, and inefficient emergency response. Therefore, the adoption of the mitigation measures recommended in the Blueprint is essential to reduce these risks and ensure the safety and well-being of all occupants in the neighbourhood.
