This category of Risks describes the various environmental and climate-related challenges that can impact individuals and communities living in green buildings and neighborhoods. These risks include climate change and environmental damage, reliance on fossil fuels, decreased carbon emissions, inefficient energy usage, urban overheating and heat waves, inadequate HVAC systems, energy poverty, and insufficient adoption of clean energy technologies. The risks also encompass challenges in global climate diplomacy, inadequate funding for climate action, and the perception of climate change as a distant threat. Additionally, the risks address factors such as temperature fluctuations, weather conditions, and the disconnection between extreme weather events and climate change. Overall, individuals listed in this group are those who are affected by or involved in mitigating the environmental and climate-related risks associated with green buildings and infrastructure.
