* I highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in practice for safer green building neighborhoods. The blueprint presents a strategic approach to mitigate the danger of contagious diseases. The measures outlined include practicing social distancing, leveraging wastewater-based epidemiology, encouraging mass vaccination, enforcing quarantine guidelines for those affected, and imposing internal travel constraints. Furthermore, it relies on technological advancements such as IoT, physical space monitoring systems, wearable devices, and the internet for effective implementation. Simply put, it's a comprehensive guide, leveraging technology, established health practices, and vigilant monitoring to ensure safety in high-density residential areas.

* Stakeholders including government authorities, building owners, healthcare institutions, health organizations, and building managers can implement the blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The 'Blueprint' aims at mitigating several risks. These include the potential rapid spread of diseases, the susceptibility to vector-borne diseases, lack of awareness about disease prevention, delayed disease reporting, airborne transmission, and the possible introduction of new disease strains. It further covers risks peculiar to high-density areas such as increased prevalence of respiratory diseases, climate-associated diseases and gnawing damage that contributes to disease spread.
