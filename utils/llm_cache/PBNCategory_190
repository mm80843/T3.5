This category of Technologies describes various molecular and genetic testing techniques used for analyzing nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. These techniques include quantitative rt-pcr methodology, rt-qpcr assay, pcr techniques, dna/rna extraction methods, real-time rt-pcr, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr, pcr assay, qrt pcr testing, nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction, improved rt-qpcr assays and sequencing techniques, digital rt-qpcr assay, taqman rt-qpcr assay, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt-qpcr, rt-qpcr, qpcr techniques, monitoring techniques for rna degradation, dpcr, qrt-pcr, and rt-pcr. These methods are commonly used in medical and biological research to detect and measure specific genetic material, identify diseases, and monitor gene expression. Additionally, this category includes technologies like backup generators and qr code scanners, which are not directly related to nucleic acid testing, but can be useful in supporting laboratory operations and data management during testing processes.
