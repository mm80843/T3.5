This category of Technologys describes a range of technologies and methods used in green buildings and infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions and prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These Technologys include advanced mass spectrometry, which is used for analytical chemistry and the identification of receptor molecules, as well as photocatalytic oxidation systems and filters that use photocatalysts like TiO2 to remove pollutants from the air. Other methods include electrostatic space charge systems, which help reduce the spread of airborne pathogens, and the use of disinfectants such as liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite to sanitize surfaces. Additionally, this category includes the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, silver nanocoatings, titanium-based coatings, and graphene-based nanomaterials for self-cleaning surfaces and antimicrobial properties. 3D printing and additive manufacturing are also used for component manufacturing, while low-carbon technologies, non-toxic nanomaterials, and low-pollutant-emitting products contribute to the overall sustainability of green buildings. In terms of disinfection, hydrogen peroxide, biocidal agents, quaternary ammonium polymers, and activated carbon are employed. Other methods include the use of electrolytic cells, cold-spray techniques for copper coatings, and biological and chemical methods using substances like sodium chloride, chlorine, and chloramine. This category also includes techniques for nucleic acid extraction, such as adsorption-elution and the use of silica gel desiccant rotors, as well as the detection and analysis of pollutants through mass spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Overall, these Technologys represent a comprehensive set of tools and approaches for creating healthier and more sustainable green buildings and infrastructure.
