* I highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in practice. It is essentially a plan that handles risks related to indoor and outdoor air quality in our buildings and neighbourhoods. The plan involves monitoring the quality of indoor air, maintaining heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC), and using indoor plants as natural air filters. It also incorporates the use of energy-efficient heating and cooling, and maintaining natural ventilation and thermal comfort at home. By implementing these measures, we can mitigate risks associated with poor air circulation, pollutants, and the spread of airborne diseases.

* The stakeholders that can implement the 'Blueprint' extents from building owners and facility managers to architects, HVAC specialists, and the building occupants themselves.

* Essentially, the risks listed in the 'Blueprint' revolve around the quality of air we breathe both indoor and outdoor. They include allergic reactions to pollen, indoor air contamination, inadequate ventilation and air filtration, poor air circulation, accumulation of dirt in HVAC systems, and the spread of diseases through airborne transmission, among other factors. These risks pose a significant threat to the health of individuals, particularly those spending a lot of time in buildings such as offices, homes, and health care facilities.
