* The blueprint encompasses a targeted response to a category of risks related to unavailable, unreliable or improper management and sharing of data, particularly as it pertains to disease spread in green-building neighborhoods. Green buildings, while being energy efficient, also pose certain challenges with regards to circulating ventilation and consequent propagation of air borne diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive data management and analysis program is essential to predict, prevent, and manage contagious diseases in these particular infrastructures.

* Several challenges are identified in this blueprint that underscore the need for implementing effective strategies. The primary risks include limited data availability, non-interoperable data, risks to data security and privacy, data capture challenges and more. These risks severely hinder informed decision-making when it comes to pandemic management and public health-related issues, especially in the context of green buildings. Moreover, the risks flesh out the requirement for standardized data structures, secured data linkages, and sophisticated computational approaches that can leverage the data to forecast disease trends and monitor their spread.

* This blueprint suggests numerous mitigation measures. Primarily, these involve the development of platforms and tools that facilitate real-time epidemiological data analysis and sharing. The utilization of the nCov2019 package, combined with real-time dashboards, would enhance data accessibility. These platforms would streamline data collection and analysis, leading to improved comprehension about the virus behavior and characteristics. Utilizing technologies such as IoT, AI, UV lamps, sensors, and machine learning, the proposed blueprint offers a comprehensive data management and analysis system.

* The benefits received from implementing this mitigation measure or blueprint, are multifold. It could lead to effective inactivation of viruses, particularly those airborne ones common in the context of green buildings, and therefore directly contribute to curbing disease spread. Applied as a tool for crisis management, the blueprint would also allow for real-time tracking, predicting, and controlling disease spread, and consequently reduce public health risks. This would facilitate the creation of a safer environment for the inhabitants of green buildings, improving public health outcomes and enabling smarter utilization of resources.
