* The blueprint that this document presents serves as a mitigation strategy against a multitude of risks linked with the operation and habitation of green buildings and neighbourhoods. These holistic areas of concern include environmental and climatic impacts that are often overlooked when the focus is narrowly on building sustainability and energy efficiency. This comprehensive approach ensures that the concerns of all the stakeholders, from facility managers to policymakers, are factored in when addressing these risks.

* The main risks this blueprint is designed to tackle emanate from both natural and human-driven climate change. It includes challenges of urban overheating, energy poverty, inefficient energy usage and reliance on fossil fuels, inadequate HVAC systems, and the insufficient adoption of clean energy technologies. Moreover, complexities of global climate diplomacy and inadequate funding for climate action are also considered, underlining the tricky balance between environmental stewardship and political will. The perception of climate change as a distant threat is a noteworthy risk, highlighting an often underrepresented aspect of climate change; the psychological disconnection that exists towards current climate impacts.

* As part of the mitigations proposed in the blueprint, it calls for both procedural actions and tools. It suggests implementing energy-saving measures and sustaining high ventilation rates to combat urban overheating and ensure energy efficiency. Furthermore, there is a promotion of using sustainable and alternative energy sources as part of an aggressive move towards decarbonization. Technical implementations include sophisticated HVAC systems, occupancy sensors, solar chargers, optimization algorithms NSGA-II, and smart power strips, which aim to foster optimal energy usage and reduction.

* The implementation of this blueprint will have manifold advantages. It will lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, and consequently, the associated costs. That will make green buildings and infrastructure more economically viable and attractive proposition for future investment. Contributing to the reduction in temperature through improved ventilation and HVAC systems, it will enhance the living and working conditions, thus, increase the occupant comfort. Furthermore, with intelligent systems in place, it presents an opportunity to reduce global transmission, helping in the fight against contagious diseases, thereby serving a dual purpose of public health and environmental protection.
