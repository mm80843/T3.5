* The Blueprint detailed herein provides a strategic and targeted approach towards addressing risks associated with contagious diseases within the unique context of green building neighbourhoods. Given the inherently communal way of living in such residential areas, the transmission of diseases may potentially be higher, especially where population densities and frequent human interaction are a given. Risks can further increase due to factors such as inadequate knowledge about disease transmission, delayed disease reporting, airborne transmission, climate-associated diseases and the threats posed by pests such as mosquitoes and ticks.

* The risks needing mitigation within this blueprint are multifaceted. They range from the direct physical threat of vector-borne and airborne diseases to the more abstract risks associated with a lack of disease understanding and knowledge. Important considerations include the quick pace at which diseases may spread amongst a closely-knit community, the emergence of new disease strains, and the tardy reporting of infectious diseases â€“ all of which could extend the reach of an outbreak. Other risks tied to the increased prevalence and importation of diseases have also been flagged, as have concerns about the vulnerability of specific groups, such as healthcare workers, to infection.

* Mitigation measures within this blueprint focus heavily on enforcing and ensuring the practice of social distancing protocols within such neighbourhoods. Through careful implementation of measures such as wastewater-based epidemiology, extensive vaccination drives, quarantine rules, and internal travel constraints, it is envisaged that the risk of disease spread could be substantially diminished. In addition, the integration of various technologies such as IoT, physical distance monitoring systems, and technology-enabled measures are proposed to strengthen mitigation efforts. These proposed measures also involve stakeholders like the government, building owners, healthcare institutions and organizations, building managers, and many more.

* The benefits of implementing this blueprint are compelling. The mitigation measures have not only the potential to substantially reduce the risk of infection and transmission but also to increase the asset value of green buildings neighbourhoods. As such, this blueprint offers a more substantial, structured, and concerted response to the risks posed by contagious diseases, simultaneously laying the groundwork for healthier, safer, and more prosperous communities.
