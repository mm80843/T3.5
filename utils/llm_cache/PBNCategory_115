This category of Mitigations describes a range of measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, specifically in green building neighborhoods. These measures include limiting media exposure, providing alternative means for basic functions, implementing wildlife trade bans, shutting down borders, implementing lockdowns at various levels (such as federated, zone-based, local, and conditional), enforcing lockdown measures, promoting transparent governance, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. Other measures include restricting population flow, maintaining infrastructure, implementing occupancy limitations, controlling visitor access, restricting access to shared facilities, ensuring adequate sanitation, restricting access to public parks, implementing eviction diversion programs and civil rights to counsel in eviction cases. There are also measures related to physical barriers and partitions, temporary closure of access points, limited access nodes, restrictions on shared facilities and uses, reduction in traffic, isolation facilities, and the temporary closure of non-essential public places. Additionally, there are measures related to curfews, transmission chain disruption, stopping mass gatherings, restricting movement, closing borders, enhancing accessibility, non-contact interaction, clear contractual arrangements, and reimaging post-lockdown workplace rules. The list also includes measures such as suspension of public visitors, deferring or suspending taxes, robustness of critical infrastructure, enhancing accessibility for low-income residents, implementing movement restrictions, government bailouts, implementing hands-free door opening, strengthening enforcement, implementing policies to address inequalities, limiting product range, regulating rotations between different sites, and limiting misinformation. By implementing these Mitigations, individuals and communities can protect themselves and reduce the risk of contagious disease transmission.
