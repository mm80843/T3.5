This category of Stakeholders represents a diverse group of individuals who are either occupants, visitors, workers, or residents in various indoor environments. They include people in crowded spaces such as offices, workplaces, and residential buildings. They also encompass individuals living in noisy areas, poorly ventilated buildings, or spaces with poor air circulation and distribution. Additionally, this group includes individuals in indoor environments with poor environmental controls, inadequate ventilation systems, or contaminated surfaces. They may be exposed to chemical pollutants, lack natural light, or be affected by inadequate air filtration or disinfection measures. Public health authorities, meteorological agencies, and individuals responsible for maintaining cleanliness and hygiene in buildings are also part of this stakeholder category. Overall, this group represents anyone who spends time indoors and is impacted by the quality of the indoor environment, particularly in relation to contagious diseases spread and the effectiveness of existing infrastructure and ventilation systems.
