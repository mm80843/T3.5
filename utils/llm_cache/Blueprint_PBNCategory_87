* The Blueprint under consideration holds significant implications for the realm of green buildings and interconnected neighbourhoods. It specifically deals with the risks revolving around indoor and outdoor air quality, effectively bridging the gap between the built environment and health safety. Allergic respiratory responses, indoor air contamination, inadequate ventilation, poor air circulation and the spread of airborne diseases are among the factors addressed by this Blueprint. The areas this Blueprint primarily impacts range from residential and commercial buildings to healthcare facilities and more generally any indoor spaces.

* Risks identified as part of this Blueprint are multifold, and require immediate attention considering their extensive implications for public health and safety. They primarily stem from insufficient air quality, be it outdoor or indoor, and encompass a vast array of issues. These include but are not limited to the responses to allergens such as pollen, indoor air contamination, the negative impact of pollutants like volatile organic compounds and secondhand smoke, poor air circulation, as well as the buildup of microbes in HVAC systems. The stakeholders that are most likely to be affected and potentially contribute to these risks sum up to building occupants, healthcare facilities, and anyone that spends time indoors, especially those in office buildings.

* The Blueprint provides comprehensive mitigation measures to address the identified risks. At its core, these measures maintain a focus on regular indoor air quality monitoring and HVAC maintenance, energy-efficient heating and cooling, natural ventilation and thermal comfort for residential environments, as well as implementation of natural air filters like indoor plants. These techniques are to be implemented by a range of key stakeholders, including building owners, facility managers, architects, HVAC specialists and the occupants themselves. Technologically, they involve utilization of efficient HVAC systems, air purifiers, floor markings, physical barriers, crowd control, advanced ventilation systems and the ongoing development of HVAC technologies.

* The implementation of the mitigation measure or the Blueprint holds numerous benefits. The most apparent of these is improved indoor air quality which has a profound impact on the health of the occupants. This will essentially lead to a reduction in the risk of infections. Besides, it also contributes to an increase in the value of the building asset. In essence, it aids in the creation of healthier indoor environments, making buildings safer and more pleasurable places to live and work in.
