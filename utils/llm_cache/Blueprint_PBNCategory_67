* The infrastructure under consideration is the complex digital ecosystem within green building neighborhoods. This ecosystem heavily relies on the deployment of modern technologies like IoT devices, wearable tech, GPS, and sophisticated data collection and processing techniques. The data ecosystem presents concerns related to privacy, security, and ethical considerations. As identified, residents, users of IoT devices and mobile apps, and healthcare providers are primarily impacted by this risk. Ultimately, a secure, ethical, and private data ecosystem is significant for maintaining the trust of these stakeholders and ensuring smooth functioning within these neighborhoods.

* The risks encapsulate everything from privacy invasion, violation of privacy laws and regulations, cybersecurity threats to data security concerns. There is also an implied risk towards freedom of speech, linked to potential over-surveillance or misuse of collected data. The risks are not limited to single entities but span various domains, including technology, healthcare, law, and public perception. The intersectionality of these risks demands an encompassing solution. Given the wide-ranging potential impacts, strategic regulation and mitigation approaches are crucial in managing these risks effectively.

* Several mitigation measures have been proposed to tackle these risks. Among them, the significant steps include implementing contact tracing, enforcing strong data protection measures, and ensuring data anonymity. Transparency and consent-based approaches are set to be foundational principles in data collection and usage. Additional measures include the use of strong data encryption techniques and secure data storage systems. Regulatory bodies, wearable device manufacturers, the government, data scientists, and data handlers have the capacity and the onus to implement these mitigation measures.

* Realizing this Blueprint has multiple benefits, most prominently in breaking the barriers for uninterrupted and effective function of the infrastructural setup. It provides an early warning of disease outbreaks and enables population-wide surveillance, which is paramount in quickly and effectively reacting to sudden health threats like Covid-19. It further reprieves the ethical, privacy, and security concerns of the stakeholders, enhancing trust and cooperation. The use of a systematic approach that safeguards privacy and promotes security is essential in fostering a resilient, secure, and thriving green building neighborhoods.
