* The blueprint in discussion pertains to contagious disease mitigation, specifically targeting virus propagation in green building neighborhoods. It is a strategic plan that aims to address and neutralize potential threats of viral spread within compact, eco-friendly living spaces. Different stakeholders are identified as part of this blueprint, including building occupants, residents, cleaning staff and facilities, along with building management that oversees the operation and maintenance of these structures. 

* The risks identified in the blueprint are primarily of two categories: direct health risks linked to virus spread (Pvp1-Pvp6) and those linked to personal comfort and community services (Pc1-PC4, Lc1-Lc2), which indirectly influence disease susceptibility and transmission. Furthermore, risks attributed to environmental factors such as air and water quality and contamination (Aq1, Aq2, Aq4 and Wq1, Wq2, Wc1, Wc2) are identified as crucial elements that directly or indirectly impact health and well-being, thus, requiring immediate attention from the stakeholders. 

* The blueprint delineates a variety of mitigation measures combining technology with practical precautions and enhanced management. Smart technologies including motion sensors, keycard swipe systems, and UV-light based interventions are employed to reduce human interaction and ensure sanitary conditions. Regular monitoring of air conditions, innovative waste management and pressure sensors are proposed, along with the use of anti-microbial materials and incorporation of self-cleaning spaces. 

* Implementing this blueprint holds significant benefits for all stakeholders, primary among which is the reduced risk of infection, which directly correlates to better health among residents. Mechanized disinfection through technologies ensures sanitized living spaces without the need for human contact, reducing the potential for inadvertent virus transmission. Alongside, improved ventilation systems and reinforced control systems promise healthier and safer environments, making the green building neighborhoods a more attractive place for inhabitants.
