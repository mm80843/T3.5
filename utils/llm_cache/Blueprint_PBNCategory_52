* The provided blueprint revolves around mental health issues that may arise within populations living in green building neighbourhoods due to various factors shadowed by the context of contagious diseases. The need for maintaining an individual's mental health becomes of utmost importance in an era of contagious diseases due to increased anxiety, fear, isolation, and limited access to mental health services. The stakeholders in this project would be healthcare providers, governments, mental health professionals, and various mental health and support organizations.

* Several risks are highlighted in the blueprint. It can be deduced from the data that the primary risk is surge in mental health-related concerns, arising from the psychological distress caused by factors linked to these diseasesâ€”like social isolation, fear, anxiety, and quarantine. Individuals experiencing any form of psychological distress, students, elderly individuals, the general population, healthcare workers, and building occupants are mentioned as the primary population under impact. The risks extend to domestic violence, stigma, discrimination, and a decrease in resources for mental health support.

* To tackle these potential threats, a series of mitigation measures have been proposed. These measures mainly aim to increase and improve access to mental health services and promote social connections to alleviate the impacts of social isolation. These steps also address the stigma associated with mental health issues, encourage self-care practices, and present healthy coping mechanisms for the involved population. Utilizing outdoor green spaces such as parks and gardens and maintaining social distancing rules are also part of the mitigation plan. 

* The implementation of this blueprint or these mitigation measures can bring forth a breadth of benefits. The foremost of these is the improvement in the mental health outcomes of the various populations living within green building communities. Secondly, the blueprint would bring about an overall improvement in well-being and health, further enhancing the quality of life of the identified groups at risk. In consequence, it would create a more congenial environment for the residents, thus fostering increased social and emotional wellbeing along with physical health.
