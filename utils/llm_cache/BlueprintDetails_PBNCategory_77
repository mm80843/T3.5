* The Blueprint envisages a multifaceted approach to implement cybersecurity measures, manage communication channels, and mitigate disinformation. The implementation involves using technologies, like blockchain, GPS, and mobile applications, to ensure transparency, and track and manage data. The application of fifth-generation wireless networks and digital contact tracing apps adds to data security and tracking. Also, setting up improved peer review processes, critically evaluating preprints and regulating media coverage are significant aspects in maintaining the credibility of data-based information.

* The stakeholders, including researchers, governments, journal editors, preprint servers, and technology companies, can implement this blueprint.

* The risks highlighted in the blueprint pertain to data security, comprising threats like hacking, security breaches, misuse of data, inadequate compliance, fraudulent data, and research activities, among others. It underscores the need for data encryption, ethical handling, and regulation to mitigate these challenges. Notably, it also flags issues such as manipulated media coverage and potential misdiagnoses as significant risks.
