This category of Risks describes various aspects related to the spread and transmission of contagious diseases, particularly in green building neighborhoods. It includes risks such as lack of knowledge on disease transmission mechanisms, local and global disease diffusion, introduction of new disease vectors, fear of infection in urban green spaces, inaccurate identification and tracking of infected individuals, low testing frequency in previously infected individuals, spread of infection in the workplace, changes in disease distribution, transmission from infected individuals, spread of other pathogens in hospitals, inefficient disease identification, zoonotic disease emergence, close contact with infected individuals, underreporting of infections, asymptomatic infections, risk of infection through face-to-face contact, potential breach of privacy, and many others.
