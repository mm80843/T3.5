This category of Mitigations describes a range of actions and strategies related to wastewater and water management, waste management, and infrastructure improvement. It includes measures such as wastewater-based monitoring, surveillance, and epidemiology, as well as adjusting for wastewater temperature. It also covers sewage surveillance and epidemiology, the development of quantitative models for interpreting wastewater data, and implementing wastewater treatment processes to remove pathogens. The category also encompasses strategies for improving water systems, including the development of alternative water sources, enhanced water treatment processes, and provision of water infrastructure. Waste management measures include proper waste segregation, disposal, and recycling, as well as implementing waste management strategies. The category also includes actions related to plumbing, groundwater testing, and disposal protocols for waste. Additionally, it covers strengthening wastewater treatment, enhancing drainage systems, and improving solid waste management. The category further includes the development and implementation of biosensor systems for wastewater analysis, as well as the monitoring and testing of wastewater samples for early detection of pathogens. Other measures include adjusting surveillance focus, proper PPE usage and disposal, promoting sustainable design and construction practices, access to clean cooking fuels, and the sealing of pipes. Finally, it encompasses the improvement and proper disposal of filters, chemicals, and pharmaceutical wastes, as well as developing correction methods for variations in sewage flow.
