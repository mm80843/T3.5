* The Blueprint proposes a comprehensive and proactive approach towards mitigating the transmission of contagious diseases, especially airborne viruses such as coronavirus, within green building neighbourhoods. It involves standardizing the awareness and knowledge about these viruses, implementing preventive measures such as controlling temperature and humidity levels within buildings, promoting the use of touchless technologies, and implementing proper air filtration systems. The blueprint also emphasizes natural rays of light in interiors and self-cleaning spaces to limit virus survival and transmission. Crucially, it encourages a reconsideration of cleaning practices and calls for measures against potential spread of viruses through less obvious means, such as wastewater and vertical shafts.

* Building owners, facility managers, healthcare institutions, government authorities, and cleaning staff can implement this blueprint.

* The blueprint encompasses a broad spectrum of risks, primarily tied to the transmission and survival of airborne respiratory viruses such as the coronavirus. Notably, it sheds light on the role high humidity and close-quarter contact can play in increasing virus transmission. It also addresses less obvious avenues of potential spread, such as improper cleaning practices and presence of viruses in wastewater. Ultimately, the blueprint underlines the need for a multidirectional approach to combat the spread of contagious diseases within built environments.
