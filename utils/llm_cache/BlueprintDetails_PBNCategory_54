* My professional recommendation is to fully implement the 'Blueprint' mitigation plans in the field of infrastructure, specifically in green buildings neighbourhoods. The essential core of this blueprint revolves around social distancing. By maintaining strict social distancing protocols, limiting the number of workers in small spaces, and spacing out work areas, the pernicious spread of infectious diseases can be minimised. To counter the negative impact of isolation, the blueprint suggests using digital technology for remote social interaction, promoting community involvement and providing mental health resources to those in need. It discusses the benefits of incorporating design elements such as physical space, barriers, and floor markings, as well as technology-enabled monitoring systems and Internet of Things devices, to keep infectious diseases at bay.

* Stakeholders such as healthcare organisations, government departments, employers, and community organisations have the capability to implement the blueprint.

* 'Building'

* The risks outlined in the 'Blueprint' primarily focus on the issues tied to social distancing, the lack of social interaction, the psychological impact of social isolation, disparities in social and economic situations, and the possible negative perception of particular inhabitants in housing. These risks serve to underline the significant relevance of social distancing, the potential impact on mental health, and the effect of social inequalities on the spread of infectious diseases.
