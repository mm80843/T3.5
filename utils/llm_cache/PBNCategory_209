This category of Interventions describes the implementation of separate water facilities, specifically toilets and bathrooms, for individuals who are contaminated with a contagious disease. This measure aims to prevent the spread of the disease within a green building neighborhood or infrastructure. By providing segregated facilities, contaminated individuals can avoid direct contact with others, reducing the risk of transmission and protecting the overall health of the community.
