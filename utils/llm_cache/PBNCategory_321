This category of Themes describes two essential aspects of environmental health in infrastructure, namely water quality and air quality. Water quality refers to the cleanliness and purity of the water supply, including the absence of contaminants and pollutants that could pose health risks. Air quality, on the other hand, refers to the level of pollutants and toxins present in the air, which can be detrimental to human health if they exceed safe limits. These Themes focus on assessing and improving the quality of water and air within green building neighborhoods, with the aim of creating healthier and more sustainable living environments.
