* The scope of this blueprint pertains to the management, accessibility, and risks associated with urban green spaces and infrastructure. With the increase in urbanization, green spaces have become a critical part of city planning, contributing to both the physical well-being of city dwellers and the ecological balance of the urban environment. However, the existence and efficacy of these spaces are strained by various factors, further magnified during the recent Covid-19 pandemic. 

* The blueprint identifies a variety of risks challenging the establishment and maintenance of green urban spaces. These risks range from the loss of urban biodiversity and substandard distribution of green spaces to its diminished appeal during the pandemic. High installation and maintenance costs of green roofs further deter their proliferation within residential sectors. Public parks' reliance on government intervention, and exceedingly low visits only highlight the issue further. The risks also highlight how disadvantaged communities are affected due to the poor quality of green spaces available to them.

* To mitigate such risks, the blueprint suggests incentives for green roofs installation and developing cost-effective maintenance strategies. Raising public awareness about green roof benefits through education and outreach programs, and advancing research can help rectify the situation. Incorporating green spaces in healthcare facilities and creating healing gardens can also improve their overall appeal and utility. To address gender-based disparities, gender-specific research on green space benefits can be beneficial in strategizing targeted interventions. 

* The blueprint's benefits are manifold. The provisioning of urban green spaces significantly improves mental health, contributes to overall health benefits, and supports wildlife living within the urban perimeter. The implementation of this blueprint would lead to an equitable distribution of green spaces, increased public awareness about their importance, conservation of urban biodiversity, and a more inclusive urban environment for all residents. It ultimately aspires to create sustainable, livable, and healthy urban spaces.
