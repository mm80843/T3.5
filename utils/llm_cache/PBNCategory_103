This category of Mitigations describes a range of measures aimed at improving surveillance, monitoring, and tracking of individuals and vectors to mitigate the spread of contagious diseases. These measures include increased surveillance and support services, strengthening surveillance and control programs, enhanced surveillance and reporting, development of novel surveillance systems, improved reporting and communication channels, and implementing digital tracking tools. They also encompass monitoring people movement during events, tracking medical personnel, home security monitoring, population screening, and implementing smart CCTV cameras. The category further includes measures such as vector surveillance and control, adaptive hospital surveillance-based triggers, real-time tracking of infected patients, and implementing a patient monitoring system with video surveillance and vital sign monitoring equipment. These mitigations highlight the importance of enhancing surveillance systems, investing in research and development, and using technology to track and trace transmissions, detect emerging diseases, and respond rapidly to zoonotic diseases. Overall, these measures aim to improve the capacity and resilience of the health sector, increase testing capacity, implement contact tracing strategies, and raise public awareness of risks to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure settings such as green buildings neighbourhoods.
