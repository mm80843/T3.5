* I highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in green building neighborhoods to mitigate risks associated with water and waste management. The 'Blueprint' suggests solutions such as developing proper drainage and maintenance systems to avoid water stagnation and site selection procedures to avoid areas prone to flooding. Additionally, it encourages the reduction of traffic volumes to limit environmental pollution and suggests the installation of high-grade filters and sealing to avoid airborne diseases. Finally, it proposes standardization of PCR platforms and protocols for early detection of possible viral pathogens.

* The 'Blueprint' can be implemented by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, water utilities, researchers, building owners, and laboratory personnel.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks addressed in the 'Blueprint' include deteriorating biodiversity, environmental contamination, and pollution due to poor water and waste management. It also covers risks related to increased water consumption, improper wastewater management, and inadequate waste recycling. The 'Blueprint' identifies these as significant threats to the health and safety of individuals residing in green building neighborhoods.
