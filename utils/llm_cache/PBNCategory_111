This category of Mitigations describes a wide range of strategies and actions that can be taken to prevent the spread of contagious diseases, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods. These Mitigations include the development of medical infrastructure, the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, improved hygiene practices, proactive case finding and isolation of cases, medication delivery through blockchain, addressing disease stigma, reducing time from diagnosis to surgery, increased personal hygiene, management of increased waste, respiratory etiquette, health monitoring, AI-powered applications for diagnosis and treatment, patient and healthcare worker asymptomatic screening programs, proper coughing and sneezing techniques, design considerations for disease transmission, isolation and quarantine measures, patient education, and enhanced health literacy. Other Mitigations focus on specific medical interventions such as drug therapies, biomarker monitoring, proteolysis of s protein by cathepsin, and the use of therapeutic drugs. Additionally, the Mitigations include the use of AI-driven tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, disease modeling, wearables for symptom management, and the promotion of hygiene and awareness about asymptomatic transmission. The use of blockchain technology for medical record management and diagnosis confirmation is also mentioned. Overall, these Mitigations cover a broad range of strategies aimed at preventing the spread of contagious diseases and improving public health in green buildings neighborhoods.
