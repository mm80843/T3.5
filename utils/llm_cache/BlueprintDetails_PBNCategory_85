* I highly recommend the implementation of the 'Blueprint' in practice, with it addressing a number of key risks related to the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. This plan prescribes measures such as improving indoor air quality, upgrading heating and cooling systems, and ensuring proper cleaning and disinfection protocols are in place. This is done alongside suggestions for improving lighting, acoustics, maintaining temperature and humidity levels, and improving filtration systems. No particular technical expertise is required as the blueprint provides straightforward instructions that can be easily adopted.

* Multiple stakeholders such as facility managers, building owners, building occupants, employers, and governments are eligible and encouraged to implement the blueprint.

* The risks detailed in the blueprint include a variety of factors that can contribute to the spread and impact of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These include a lack of occupant exposure modelling and indoor environmental data, environmental degradation, poor spatial organisation, excessive reliance on artificial lighting and ventilation, inadequate natural lighting, indoor pollutants, inadequate thermal comfort, and a lack of housing hygiene. These risks highlight the pressing need to address these issues to preserve indoor climate and public health.
