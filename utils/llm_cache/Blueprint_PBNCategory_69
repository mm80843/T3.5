* The global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for preventative and mitigation strategies to manage and reduce the spread of infectious diseases, especially in urban spaces, one of which is green buildings neighbourhoods. Given the virus's ability to circulate in enclosed spaces and affect a large number of individuals heightens the need for robust measures to counter this grave threat. This need forms the basis for our blueprint, specifically designed to address concerns tied to these built environments, incorporating spatial design, technology, and ongoing management practices to promote health and prevent disease transmission.

* Risks associated with the spread and impact of COVID-19 within or around green buildings neighbourhoods are multi-faceted, extending from transmission within public housing, streets, buildings to specific environments such as healthcare facilities and construction sites. Also, social, economic, and psychological risks like the amplification of existing inequalities, heightened fear and stigma, and mental health challenges cannot be overlooked. The lack of adequate preventive measures, non-compliance with solitude measures, and limited access to up-to-date information compound the risk profile, affecting sectors from construction to immigration. Misinformation, inadequate testing, and waste management, coupled with strained healthcare systems, complete the spectrum of threats that need to be managed.

* Mitigation measures proposed by this blueprint include clear social distancing protocols, travel restrictions, comprehensive wastewater surveillance, and in extreme conditions, implementation of total lockdowns. Some approaches may be simplistic like floor markings or physical barriers allowing for better flow management and distancing. Others involve advanced technological solutions, including the use of HVAC systems, air purifiers, wearable devices to enhance environmental safety, and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate the efficient management of these measures. There is also a critical component of public awareness and educational campaigns to ensure understanding and cooperation from all stakeholders.

* The implementation of this blueprint comes with numerous benefits from reducing transmission, protecting society's most vulnerable, enhancing indoor air quality to improving property value. In doing so, it ensures the health and wellbeing of residents, visitors, and workers within these spaces, thereby fostering a safer and more resilient community in face of this and any future health crises. It's a way to balance disruption, health and economic factors in a delicate equation that ultimately favours safety, peace and continued vitality.
