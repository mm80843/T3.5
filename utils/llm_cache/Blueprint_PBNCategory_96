* The 'Blueprint' refers to a strategic mitigation plan associated with the risks inherent in the use and implementation of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) systems, particularly in green buildings and healthcare facilities. As an international expert on contagious diseases spread in such infrastructures, I am accustomed to understanding technologies like UVGI and their potential risks, offering mitigation plans to reduce these risks, and explaining the expected benefits. These systems, despite their potential for disinfection, present risks such as improper installment or maintenance, serious health implications and lack of tested efficacy.

* The predominant risks that need considerable attention include potential occupational exposure to contagious diseases, lack of standardized protocols for testing UVGI's effectiveness, decreased operation in high humidity environments, and the requirement for adequate and proper use and maintenance of UVGI systems. Additionally, there are potential health risks if not installed and maintained accurately, apart from limited knowledge on far-UVC light exposure and UV technology. Furthermore, there's a risk associated with the health implications of UV-C radiation exposure, inadequate sunlight exposure, and cost and inconvenience related to smart face mask filters. Several stakeholders are potentially at risk, including the general population, healthcare workers, and building occupants among others.

* Mitigation strategies as suggested in the blueprint include building accurate dose-response relationship models for UVGI system optimization, emphasizing proper usage and maintenance of UVGI systems, and offering relevant training and protective equipment to service personnel and occupants. Further, it recommends using additional methods for disinfection, conducting extensive research to ascertain the effectiveness of UVGI systems in preventing healthcare-linked infections and exploring the relationship between relative humidity (RH) and UV susceptibility. Implementation of these measures would involve a diverse range of stakeholders such as building owners, facility managers, researchers, designers, and government regulators.

* Implementing this blueprint's mitigation measures would yield several benefits, including demonstrable efficacy of UV light in disinfection, an increased adoption rate of germicidal UV, and creating safer and healthier indoor environments in green buildings and healthcare facilities. The successful implementation of these measures promises more hygienic living and working spaces with a noticeably reduced risk of the spread of contagious diseases.
