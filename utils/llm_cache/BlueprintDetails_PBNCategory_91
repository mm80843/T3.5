* The 'Blueprint' is a comprehensive plan designed to mitigate risks faced by the workforce in green building neighbourhoods, including job losses, remote work challenges and workforce management issues. The mitigation strategy spells out supportive measures such as employment promotion, income support and economic recovery initiatives. It also suggests workforce reduction and contract revisions to better manage and protect the workforce. In addition, it advocates for clear communication channels and financial aid for affected workers, alongside the exploration of alternative job opportunities and safety protocol implementation. The Blueprint also acknowledges the need for specific industry-based working procedures and the utilisation of technology platforms for efficient remote work capabilities.

* The Blueprint can be implemented by stakeholders ranging from the government, construction companies, employers, to labour unions.
