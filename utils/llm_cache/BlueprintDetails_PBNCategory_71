* The 'Blueprint' aims to mitigate risks posed by contagious diseases in green-building neighborhoods. This solution entails creating a comprehensive data management and analysis system that provides direct access to real-time epidemiological data through advanced tools and platforms like the nCov2019 package and real-time dashboards. It employs technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamps and sensors. The objective is to gather reliable data on virus behavior and characteristics, understand potential risks, and monitor and manage the spread of disease effectively.

* Researchers, data scientists, governments, healthcare organizations, and data analysts are ideally equipped to implement the blueprint.

* The blueprint emphasizes various data-related risks that may hinder effective pandemic management and public health in green-building neighborhoods. These risks include limited mobility data, challenges regarding data availability, sharing, and interoperability, insufficient data for analysis, data security and privacy issues, questions on data quality and reliability, difficulties in data capture, and fragmentation of data. These issues underline the crucial role of harmonized, thorough data-driven approaches in predicting and controlling the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure.
