This category of Benefits describes various aspects related to the prevention and control of contagious diseases within infrastructure, specifically in green buildings neighborhoods. It includes measures such as estimating the state of infection, lower infection rates, reduced transmission of specific viruses like respiratory syncytial virus and influenza, as well as the reduction of airborne pathogen concentration. Other benefits encompass the destruction and inactivation of pathogens, reduction of infections and disease incidence, dilution and removal of infectious particles in room air, effective management of potentially infected waste, control over the spread of infection, and proper handling and isolation of infected individuals. Additional advantages consist of slowed growth rate of infections, averted or delayed infections, reduced tuberculosis infection, effective treatment, estimation of true number of infections, reduced number of infected people, prolonged antimicrobial activity, early detection of reinfections, retention of virucidal potency, removal of other respiratory pathogens, reduced risk of reinfection, inactivation of deposited pathogens, reduction of hospital-acquired infections, contactless delivery and disinfection, segregation of infected individuals, reduction of pathogen spread, and killing or inhibition of germs.
