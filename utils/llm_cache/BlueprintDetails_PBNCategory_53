* The 'Blueprint' is essentially a thorough action plan designed to navigate health-related issues in green buildings and neighbourhoods. It identifies various public health risks such as emotional distress, non-compliance with public health protocols, limited access to health education, among others. To combat these, the Blueprint essential incorporates a collaborative approach among healthcare professionals and authorities in developing and disseminating clear guidelines for property and facilities management. It emphasizes the criticality of public health education and awareness campaigns, and ensures the enforcement of regulations. It also advocates for innovative initiatives aimed at building resilient food systems, as well as targeted support to vulnerable populations to ensure healthcare accessibility.

* This blueprint can be implemented by several stakeholders, including government entities, public health professionals, healthcare organizations, and non-governmental organizations.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks outlined in the 'Blueprint' include a range of public health risks that can occur in neighbourhoods with green buildings. These include noncompliance with health directives, limited access to healthcare and health education, health inequities, emotional distress, inadequate urban design for disease prevention and more. These risks can potentially lead to serious health outcomes for individuals living in these neighbourhoods, and the 'Blueprint' is specifically designed to mitigate these risks.
