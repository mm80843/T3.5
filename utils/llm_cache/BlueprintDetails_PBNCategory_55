* I would highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in practice. This blueprint proposes a comprehensive approach to managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods, built with an environmentally friendly design, sometimes unintentionally create spaces that could assist in disease transmission. To prevent this, the blueprint proposes several measures such as employing a digital contact tracing application, screening at a broad scale, implementing rigorous infection control measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and enforcing social distancing. These measures would be carried out with the help of technologies like internet-based communication, wearable devices, IoT, technology-enabled monitoring systems, physical barriers, and floor markings.

* The stakeholders who have the capacity to implement the blueprint include Governments, public health agencies, healthcare organisations, and building owners.

* Considering the nature of the impact, the scope of the blueprint is best described as 'Neighbourhood'.

* The risks described in the blueprint include factors that enhance disease transmission like inadequate understanding of disease transmission mechanisms, inaccurate identification of infected individuals, and inefficient disease identification. The blueprint also addresses issues related to local and global disease diffusion, spread of other pathogens in hospitals, underreporting of infections, as well as more specific aspects such as transmission from infected individuals and the spread of zoonotic diseases. These risks are heightened by fears of infection in urban green spaces and potential breaches of privacy in disease tracking and control.
