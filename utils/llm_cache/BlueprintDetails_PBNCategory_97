* The "Blueprint" provides a comprehensive guide to mitigate the risks of airborne diseases, particularly SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), in green buildings neighbourhoods. The implementation involves enhanced wastewater treatment processes and efficacious sanitation measures that target the primary medium of the virus transmission. It promotes regular and meticulous wastewater sampling to offer early infection detection, aiding in immediate control measures. The Blueprint pushes for the development of advanced, standardized protocols and highly sensitive assays for effective virus detection in environmental samples, ensuring data consistency crucial for virus monitoring. Adaptation of progressive treatment processes aiming at an increased removal efficiency of the virus's RNA in our wastewater systems forms a crucial part of it. 

* Wastewater treatment plant operators, research institutions, health departments, public health authorities, and regulatory agencies can implement this blueprint.

* The blueprint addresses several risks related to the spread and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater systems. It raises concerns about the transmission of the disease via wastewater, the virus's undetected presence, and the decay of the virus in wastewater. The blueprint also brings into light the low sensitivity of current testing methods, the lack of standardization in detection methods, and inefficient removal of virus fragments in the wastewater treatment processes.
