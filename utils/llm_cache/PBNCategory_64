This category of Risks describes a wide range of challenges and issues that can arise in relation to contagious diseases spread in infrastructure, specifically in green buildings neighbourhoods. These risks encompass various aspects such as individual exposure, urban management, inequality, connectivity issues, interrupted education, general anxiety, interoperability, integration challenges, identification of effective drug compounds, global pandemics, governance, privacy, security challenges, cybersecurity, control, material shortage, recruitment challenges, remote collaboration, language barriers, communication challenges, cruise ship docking, panic buying, pervasive anxiety, uncertainty, religious pilgrimages, time limitation, parameter identification issue, unknown parameter values, model identification, improper implementation, cost, error accumulation, crowd congestion, unemployment, emerging pandemics, poverty increase, increased default rates, stigmatization, poor acoustics, contamination, crises, limited pre-event preparations, limited innovation, noise pollution, beach pollution, cross-infection, legal issues, comfort, and efficiency, spread from outside, mechanisms, food security, gender inequality, shielding, overwhelming customization, community mitigation, timing of community measures, waste, unclean environment, improper installation, productivity, shortage, poor indoor air quality, negative emotions, emergency facilities, globalization, testing, equipping hospitals, school closures, exaggerated estimates, non-evidence-based measures, community relations, management, personnel management, process problems, insufficient preparation, contractual issues, cell entry, fecal shedding, cyberchondria, gatherings, inventory shortage, client confidence, compliance, infringement on privacy, high positivity rate, limited response rate, high occupant density, chemical pollutants, time overrun, fomite spread, obesity, regionalization, delayed decision making, contagion, force majeure, forced early, digital exclusion, resilience, sanitation, negative consequences, variation in interior finishing materials, uncontrolled migration, ensuring supplies, invasion of privacy, miscommunication, expertise, recontamination, increased congestion, neighbor annoyance, breach of confidentiality, adversity and challenges, logical inconsistencies, contextual factors, low efficiency, VOC pollution, essential goods, border control, administrative controls, non-flourishing individuals, scalability, trust, loneliness, low precision, limited rotations, limited operative, minimized surgery, faculty engagement, exclusion and inequality, curfew, inequities and exclusions, training and education, direct contact, induction process, environmental-based spread from Wuhan, distribution, alexithymia, infodemic, forecast accuracy, close contact, mixed messaging, screening, revenge pollution, close person-to-person contact, noncompliance, quality, close proximity, neoliberalism, outdated assumptions, identity verification, user acceptance, silos, and questionable issues. These risks encompass a wide range of challenges, from individual health and well-being to societal and systemic issues, and can impact various aspects of infrastructure and society in green buildings neighborhoods.
