* I recommend the implementation of the 'Blueprint' to mitigate the risks associated with contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. The blueprint provides clear actions that can be taken to strengthen the safety of building occupants, visitors, and employees. These include employing filtration systems, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and the incorporation of an Upper-Room UVGI system. Practices like ensuring natural ventilation can help reduce the risk of infection. All these measures, combined with technology-enabled monitoring systems, can massively curb the spread of diseases in these infrastructures. Public awareness and education campaigns are also crucial, as they empower people to protect themselves and reduce the overall risk.

* Building owners, facility managers, organizations, office managers, and individuals can implement the blueprint.

* The risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods include the transmission through disease carriers, surfaces, close contact, direct and indirect contact, air, droplets, respiratory mechanisms, and travel-related activities. Specific types of infectious diseases like influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, and zoonotic diseases are included. Furthermore, the risks involve asymptomatic transmission, fecal-oral transmission, hidden transmission, and transmission from mother to child. There's also the potential for bacterial growth and transmission and the role of different mediums in facilitating the spread of diseases.
