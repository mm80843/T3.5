* I recommend implementing the Blueprint, which provides a framework for mitigating the risks associated with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in sustainable neighborhoods. The implementation process is straightforward and involves adopting hygiene protocols such as frequent cleaning and disinfection routines, enforcing use of personal protective equipment, and promoting good hand hygiene. In addition, physical measures such as floor markings for social distancing, employing HVAC systems for efficient indoor air circulation, and using air purifiers should be in place. Also, leveraging wastewater-based epidemiology for tracking COVID-19 prevalence is suggested.

* Stakeholders such as healthcare institutions, scientists, government bodies and health authorities can implement the Blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The Blueprint lists numerous risks including the transmission of the virus through the air, droplets, and physical contacts, its survival on diverse surfaces, unmanaged spread, and potential of resistance development towards anti-virus coatings. Furthermore, it outlines the challenges associated with removing the virus from wastewater treatment plants and existing uncertainties about the virus's origin.
