* I would highly recommend the implementation of this blueprint for mitigating risks linked to water safety, excessive water consumption, waste management practices and systems in green buildings and neighbourhoods. The main aim of this blueprint is to safeguard the health and wellbeing of the community including residents and waste management professionals among others. The implementation begins with proper segregation of medical waste and disinfection of household waste, followed by the development of waste separation, disinfection strategies and a general waste management system. Furthermore, the handling of an increased amount of waste forms part of the mitigation plan. Technologies such as waste management systems, safe management protocols and water treatment systems are key components of this blueprint.

* The stakeholders who are eligible to implement this blueprint are waste management authorities and agencies, facility managers, building owners and general facilities.

* 'Neighbourhood' 

* The risks listed in the blueprint mainly revolve around water safety and consumption as well as waste management practices and systems in green building neighbourhoods. These risks include inadequate water safety practices, excessive water consumption, inappropriate waste management practices and systems which have potential to cause comfort, efficiency and life-threatening conditions like contaminated water and improperly managed waste. Implementing this blueprint effectively manages these risks thus improving living conditions and the overall efficiency of the neighbourhood.
