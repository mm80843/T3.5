* The risks discussed in this blueprint span the broad spectrum of issues related to the transmission of contagious diseases in green buildings and densely populated neighbourhoods. The significance of these risks is further heightened as urbanized societies are increasingly gravitating towards high-density living arrangements, underscoring the importance of mitigating the transmission of diseases in such environments. The targeted audience of this blueprint includes general public, healthcare workers, vulnerable populations and building occupants, and the stakeholders who can implement the mitigation measures range from individuals to healthcare institutions, governments, and building owners.

* The risks identified in this blueprint revolve around a lack of a thorough comprehension of disease transmission patterns, subpar modeling of epidemics and population movements, spread of diseases in crowded environments, and inadequate response planning. These risks relate not only to building inhabitants but extend to all who move within these infrastructures including vulnerable individuals and healthcare workers. The risks underscore the importance of multidimensional preparedness inclusive of understanding spatial variations in disease spread and addressing the limitations of current crowd models pertaining to disease transmission mechanisms.

* Strategies outlined include a range of measures from adherence to social distancing and universal precautions to technological interventions. Regulation of indoor environment such as temperature and humidity levels to reduce flu transmission and improved ventilation are suggested measures. More advanced mitigation tactics include the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and technology-enabled monitoring systems to enforce and monitor adherence to safety measures. Furthermore, public awareness and education campaigns are suggested as crucial tools to inform and encourage adherence to safety protocols.

* The implementation of these measures offers multiple benefits. Primarily, they can lead to a reduction in the transmission of diseases thereby safeguarding the well-being of individuals in such infrastructures. Importantly, by adhering to these measures, the overall risk perception within building occupants and users can decrease, translating into increased productivity and improved mental health. With better technology and protocols in place, the buildings' vulnerability to disease spread can be significantly reduced, giving stakeholders and occupants alike peace of mind in times of health crises.
