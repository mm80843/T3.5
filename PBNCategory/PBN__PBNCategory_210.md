# __Efficiently handling and reusing wastewater for conservation and environmental sustainability.__

## Items covered in this category

* [Greywater management](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/BP/PBN__BP_Intervention_11.md)

## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes methods and practices for managing greywater, which is the wastewater generated from activities such as bathing, laundry, and dishwashing. Greywater management involves treating and recycling this water for non-potable uses, such as irrigation or toilet flushing. Implementing greywater management systems in buildings and neighborhoods can significantly reduce water consumption and strain on freshwater resources by reusing this relatively clean water.
