## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a range of measures aimed at promoting and ensuring proper hand hygiene. This includes education on proper handwashing techniques, frequent handwashing, provision of handwashing stations and hand sanitizer dispensers, regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, and implementation of hand hygiene protocols. The emphasis is on promoting and enforcing good hand hygiene practices, raising awareness of the importance of hand hygiene, and providing facilities and resources to facilitate regular handwashing and sanitization. These measures are crucial in preventing the spread of contagious diseases, particularly within green buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods.
