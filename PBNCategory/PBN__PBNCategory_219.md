## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes measures taken to promote physical distancing between individuals in order to reduce the spread of contagious diseases. Social distancing involves maintaining a certain distance, typically 6 feet or 2 meters, from others in public spaces such as work areas, shops, restaurants, and public transportation. This practice aims to minimize close contact and potential exposure to respiratory droplets that may carry infectious pathogens. It includes actions such as avoiding crowded places, gatherings, or events where maintaining distance is challenging, as well as limiting physical contact such as handshakes and hugs.
