## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes a range of issues related to domestic violence, the spread of the virus, the identification of new variants, extreme events, and the vulnerability of certain populations. It includes risks such as increased domestic violence, limited capacity of domestic violence services, financial strain as a risk factor for intimate partner violence, and lack of reliable data on intimate partner violence during the pandemic. It also encompasses concerns about the spread of the virus, the identification of new variants, and the geographic spread of the virus. Additionally, it includes risks associated with extreme events, such as extreme weather events and black swan events, as well as risks related to population movement and exposure to the virus. Other risks detailed in this category involve the lack of trust in evidence, the inefficient dissemination of evidence, and the exclusion of vulnerable groups. It also encompasses vulnerabilities in the system, including the lack of community-level vector control capacity and the lack of passive survivability.
