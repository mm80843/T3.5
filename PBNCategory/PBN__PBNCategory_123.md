## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a wide range of measures aimed at promoting hygiene and sanitation practices, improving infrastructure, and implementing protocols to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These measures include increased sanitation monitoring, improvement of sanitation infrastructure, proper hygiene measures, social distancing, and promoting remote work options. They also involve implementing strict hygiene protocols, vaccination programs, effective infection control measures, regular cleaning and disinfection, ventilation systems, and promoting personal hygiene practices. Additional measures include rodent control, use of hygienic building materials, reliance on evidence-based measures, hygiene compliance, maintenance and cleaning, provision of safe water and sanitation facilities, hygiene promotion campaigns, and education on contagious diseases and preventive measures. These measures are meant to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and communities, prevent the spread of diseases, and maintain hygienic conditions.
