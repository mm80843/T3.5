## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various challenges and issues related to urban green spaces and their accessibility, quality, and management. These Risks encompass factors such as the loss of urban biodiversity, limited access to green spaces, negative perceptions of urban green spaces during the Covid-19 pandemic, lack of equitable distribution of green spaces, high installation and maintenance costs of green roofs, inadequate provision of public parks without government intervention, and the declining visitation to urban parks. Additionally, it includes issues such as the lack of knowledge about the benefits of urban green spaces, poor quality of green space in disadvantaged communities, and the impact of lockdowns on access to green areas. This category also addresses the unequal distribution and limited understanding of green infrastructure, as well as the challenges in funding initiatives like the European Green Deal. Overall, this list captures the spectrum of Risks associated with urban green spaces, highlighting the need for greater accessibility, conservation, management, and awareness of their value and benefits.
