## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes various actions and strategies to strengthen healthcare systems and infrastructure, enhance access to healthcare services, and improve overall preparedness and response to contagious diseases. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure and facilities, increasing medical staff capacity, implementing telemedicine and mobile healthcare solutions, and improving resource allocation and coordination. It also involves measures such as enhancing containment and infection control measures, training healthcare personnel, improving antimicrobial stewardship, and strengthening healthcare protection and management. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of equitable access to healthcare services, addressing systemic inequities, and providing support and resources to healthcare workers. These mitigations also highlight the need for collaboration and communication between healthcare professionals and authorities, as well as the integration of different components of healthcare systems. Overall, these Mitigations aim to enhance healthcare capacity, improve healthcare access, and ensure effective management and response to contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods.
