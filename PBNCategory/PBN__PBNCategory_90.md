## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes a range of issues related to the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, specifically in green buildings and healthcare environments. These risks include antimicrobial resistance, the lack of long-lasting antimicrobial coatings, bacterial activity, contamination and microbial growth in insulation, pathogen contamination in hospitals, and the contamination of healthcare workers. The risks also encompass inadequate surface and air disinfection, poor operating room disinfection, and the use of ineffective disinfection technologies in hospitals. Improper disposal of infectious hospital wastes and wastewater, as well as pharmaceutical and chemical wastes, pose serious risks to public health and the environment. Additionally, insufficient disinfection, lack of sanitization protocols, inadequate decontamination measures, and the infection of cleaning staff contribute to the spread of contagious diseases. Sterilization of equipment is also highlighted as a risk factor. Overall, these risks outline the various factors that can contribute to the spread of infectious diseases within infrastructure and emphasize the importance of effective disinfection and proper waste management.
