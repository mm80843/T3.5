## Title of the category

This category of Benenefits describes the positive effects that a green building neighbourhood can have on individuals and the community. People living in these neighbourhoods often experience a sense of belonging and security, as well as a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. They also exhibit higher levels of protective behaviors and are more likely to adopt and comply with protective measures. Additionally, green buildings foster improved public trust, which can be further enhanced by establishing trust as a reference center. Residents of green building neighbourhoods also develop enhanced coping skills, leading to increased citizen cooperation and trust. The presence of green buildings also attracts attention and increases trust in official information. Moreover, individuals in these neighbourhoods are likely to identify and utilize effective coping strategies, which contributes to enhanced credibility and reputation. Ultimately, the presence of green buildings in a neighbourhood can lead to increased local engagement, ownership, and act as a deterrent to anti-social behavior.
