## Title of the category

This category of Risks represents a wide range of challenges related to the safety and protection of individuals in green building neighborhoods. It includes factors such as lack of adequate protection for staff, ineffective mitigation policies, unreliable wearable devices, and a lack of awareness about campus safety. It also encompasses issues such as compliance with hand hygiene, ineffective use of isolation facilities, and inefficient emergency response. Other risks in this category involve the low adoption and misinterpretation of preventive measures, failure to implement and comply with such measures, and inadequate safety measures in general. Furthermore, this category includes concerns about the availability and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as the insufficient protection for vulnerable groups. It also addresses the challenges of maintaining safety, building resilience capabilities, and ensuring the safety of laboratory personnel and environment during sample handling and analysis. Overall, these risks highlight the need for effective safety measures, proper training, compliance with preventive measures, and adequate resources to safeguard the well-being of individuals in green building neighborhoods.
