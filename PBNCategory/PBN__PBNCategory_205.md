## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes strategies aimed at increasing natural ventilation in buildings. Natural ventilation refers to the movement of fresh air into a building through open windows, doors, or other openings, and the subsequent removal of stale air. This can be achieved by incorporating features such as operable windows, vents, or skylights that allow for the flow of air. The individuals in this list are likely focused on implementing measures to enhance the natural ventilation in buildings and potentially improve indoor air quality.
