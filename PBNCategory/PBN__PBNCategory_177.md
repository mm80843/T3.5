## Title of the category

This category of Technologys describes various measures and tools that can be utilized to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. This includes transparency measures, surface classification, and visible transmittance to ensure clear visibility and communication. Uniform color and insulation help maintain a consistent environment, while sound insulation and sound masking devices minimize noise levels. Biometric identification and facial recognition systems provide secure and contactless access control. Protective clothing, face masks, face shields, and barriers like plexiglass create physical barriers between individuals. Education on the importance of masks and widespread use of masks promote community safety. Surface sanitization ensures cleanliness, while physical distancing markers and self-reporting functionality in wearables help maintain safe distances. Topical repellents, N95 masks, eye protection gear, and gowns provide additional layers of protection. Epidermal tattoos, contact lenses, and yoga mats are innovative approaches to personal protection. Overall, this list represents the various technologies and measures that can be employed to combat the transmission of contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods.
