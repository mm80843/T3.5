## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the various impacts of lockdowns and restricted movement on individuals and communities in green buildings neighbourhoods. These risks include social inequalities that are exacerbated by lockdowns, as well as the impact on mental health due to extended periods of lockdown. The limited accessibility to green spaces during lockdowns and the preference for green views highlight the importance of outdoor recreation and nature for well-being. The shifts in energy demands for the building sector during lockdowns and the delayed works due to lockdown indicate the challenges faced by the infrastructure sector. Additionally, the increase in neighbor noise and annoyance, both from general outdoor noise and specific sources like bird noise, further contribute to the negative effects of lockdown. Overall, this category of Risks encompasses the wide range of consequences associated with lockdowns, from mental health issues and social inequalities to the limitations and disruptions faced in green buildings neighbourhoods.
