## Title of the category

This category of Technologys describes various aspects of design, construction, and infrastructure management in the context of green buildings and neighborhoods. It includes incorporating biophilic design principles, implementing self-closing doors, adjusting area and room to member ratios, utilizing off-site and modular construction methods, and following sustainable site design and building guidelines. It also involves the use of smart building management systems, building automation systems, and building information modeling. Additionally, it encompasses the consideration of ethical and responsible building practices, improving infrastructure and housing quality, and implementing ergonomic furniture and flexible work schedules. The category also includes the design and construction of outdoor spaces, the use of physical barriers and signage, the inclusion of isolation rooms or designated areas, and the integration of reliable and smart infrastructure. Various design principles, such as adaptive and resilient design, inclusive design, and universal design, are also mentioned in relation to building layout and modifications. This category is relevant to architects, designers, building engineers, housing developers, and property developers involved in the design, construction, and management of green buildings and neighborhoods.
