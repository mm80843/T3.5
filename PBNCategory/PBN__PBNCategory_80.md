## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the various threats and challenges associated with contagious diseases spread in infrastructure, specifically focusing on green building neighborhoods. These risks include concerns such as wildlife conservation, tick-borne diseases in urban areas, the spread of diseases due to climate variability and extreme weather events, and the increased occurrence of ticks and mosquitoes in urban locations. Other risks involve the impacts of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases, increased mosquito intrusion and breeding, and the spread of invasive mosquito species. Additionally, this category encompasses concerns related to urban pests and disease vectors, the risk of west nile virus infection from urban greening, the importance of wildlife support, and the consequences of inadequate housing, sanitation, and waste management on malaria risk. Other risks involve the limitations of mosquito control programs, increased exposure to mosquitoes, the risk of zoonotic diseases from urban rats, and the increased prevalence of human schistosomiasis due to dam constructions. The presence of stagnant water and traditional materials in green buildings also attract mosquitoes and enable their access, intensifying the potential for disease transmission.
