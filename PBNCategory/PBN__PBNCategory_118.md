## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes various measures that can be implemented to address the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green building neighborhoods. These measures include promoting sustainable practices, investing in active transportation infrastructure, and encouraging active travel. It also involves improving public transportation systems, implementing travel restrictions, and conducting health screenings. Other measures include optimizing transport based on demand, managing destination image, and promoting responsible travel behavior. Additionally, this category encompasses measures such as reducing traffic volumes, developing alternative transportation options, and implementing safety measures in transportation systems. It also includes implementing crowd control measures, restructuring public transit operations, and promoting remote work and sustainable transportation options. Finally, it involves implementing migration control programs and developing global regulations and policies to address the movement of individuals across cities and regions.
