## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the potential negative impact on mental health and well-being in various populations due to factors such as increased stress, anxiety, social isolation, and limited access to mental health services. These risks are relevant to individuals experiencing mental health issues, psychological distress, emotional distress, psychiatric illness, and fatigue. It also applies to vulnerable groups, healthcare professionals, students, individuals with disabilities, the elderly, and the general population. The risks extend to the potential for increased domestic violence, stigma, discrimination, and limited resources for mental health support. The psychological effects of fear, anxiety, quarantine, and social distancing are also included, along with the impact on psychological well-being and the potential for psychopathology. These risks can have long-lasting consequences on individuals' mental and physical health, and their overall quality of life.
