## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes measures that focus on improving and managing acoustic design in buildings and neighborhoods to reduce noise levels and enhance acoustic comfort. These measures include implementing proper noise insulation and using sound-absorbing materials such as acoustic panels and partitions. They also involve regulating noise levels, promoting soundproofing measures, and considering noise reduction measures during construction or lockdown periods. Additionally, the list mentions the use of portable noise measurement devices, implementing measures to reduce bird noise, and utilizing natural sound barriers. The Mitigations in this category also highlight the importance of developing sound credit guarantee schemes for banks and enhancing sound insulation guidelines for buildings. Moreover, they suggest promoting respectful neighbor behavior and using non-intrusive audio-visual alerts.
