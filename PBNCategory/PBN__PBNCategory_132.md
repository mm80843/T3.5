## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations represents a wide range of measures and actions taken to prevent or mitigate the spread of contagious diseases within infrastructure settings, such as green building neighborhoods. It includes a variety of strategies, such as planning mechanisms, building resilience measures, privacy protection measures, advanced security measures, lockdown measures, transmission control measures, hygienic measures, temperature measurement, case-based measures, and continuation of effective measures. Additionally, it encompasses preventive measures, policy measures, containment measures, implementing safety measures, emphasizing the use of personal protective measures, travel-related measures, isolation measures, environmental measures, and regulatory measures. The category also includes measures related to social protection, risk prevention, health and prevention, collaboration, monitoring and enforcement, as well as crowd control measures. This list of Mitigations highlights the diverse set of actions and interventions that can be implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals in green building neighborhoods and mitigate the spread of contagious diseases.
