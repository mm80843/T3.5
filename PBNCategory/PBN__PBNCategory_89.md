## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various issues related to public spaces, green spaces, living spaces, and shared spaces. It includes crowded public spaces, overcrowding in public spaces, and changes in use and behavior in public spaces. It also encompasses risks associated with green spaces such as lack of green spaces, inadequate maintenance of green spaces, and limited access to green spaces. The Risks in this list also highlight problems in living spaces such as overcrowding, inadequate living spaces, and lack of private spaces. Additionally, it addresses issues like insufficient funding and maintenance for green space, inadequate cleaning policies and procedures for office spaces, and inappropriate humidity levels in indoor spaces. This category of Risks focuses on the importance of access to outdoor spaces, equitable distribution of green space, and the need for new designs and practices for green spaces. Overall, these Risks highlight the various challenges and concerns related to different types of spaces and their impact on individuals and communities.
