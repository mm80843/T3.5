## Title of the category

This category of Interventions represents strategies and measures aimed at identifying and detecting contagious diseases at an early stage. These Interventions focus on implementing systems and protocols that enable prompt detection of symptoms or signs of an infectious disease in individuals within a green building neighborhood. By identifying cases early on, health authorities can quickly initiate appropriate measures to contain the spread of the disease and mitigate its impact on the community.
