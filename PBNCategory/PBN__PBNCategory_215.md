## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes measures taken to control or prevent the spread of contagious diseases carried by animals. These interventions aim to minimize the transmission of diseases from animals to humans by implementing strategies such as removing or controlling animal populations, preventing contact between animals and humans, and implementing measures to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission through animal vectors. Individuals involved in these interventions would typically specialize in animal control and prevention methods, working to create and maintain environments that are safe and free from potential disease-carrying animals.
