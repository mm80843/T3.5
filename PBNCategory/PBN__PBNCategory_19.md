## Title of the category

This category of Benenefits describes the impact of green buildings and infrastructure on the reduction and prevention of disease transmission. It includes benefits such as decreased transmission risk, reduction in fomite and droplet transmission risk, and minimized transmission risk in communal spaces and neighborhoods. Additionally, it highlights the importance of reduced transmission through recirculated air and body fluids, as well as the prevention of transmission through sewage. Other benefits include the reduced transmission within households and among co-workers, as well as safer options for transportation with reduced vehicle emissions and transportation costs. Overall, this category emphasizes the importance of green buildings in creating safer and healthier environments, promoting social distancing, increased safety, and confidence in public transit usage, while optimizing transport.
