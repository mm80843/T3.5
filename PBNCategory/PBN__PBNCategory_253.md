## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders represents a wide range of individuals and communities who may be affected by the spread of contagious diseases, particularly in infrastructure such as green buildings neighborhoods. It includes the general population in urban areas, individuals in high-risk areas, communities living in crowded areas, communities with lower socio-economic status, communities at high risk or in higher-risk areas, and residents of densely populated areas or cities. It also encompasses vulnerable populations such as the elderly, individuals living in underserved areas or areas with high disease transmission risk, and those without access to natural environments. Additionally, it includes populations in areas with poor sanitation facilities or inadequate sanitation, communities near wildlife habitats, populations in areas with vector control programs, and urban populations in areas where invasive mosquito species are spreading. Furthermore, it involves individuals living in deprived areas, those without access to natural areas, and populations in areas with limited testing capacity or limited access to mobility datasets. This category also encompasses people in polluted areas, residents of central areas with high economic activity, and those living and working near roads with planted vegetation. Overall, it represents a diverse group of stakeholders who may be impacted by the spread of contagious diseases in various urban and rural settings, with varying levels of risk, access to resources, and vulnerability.
