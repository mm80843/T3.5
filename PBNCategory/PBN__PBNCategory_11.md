## Title of the category

This category of Benenefits describes various measures and technologies aimed at reducing contact and proximity between individuals in order to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These include the estimation of exposure metrics, improved monitoring, and efficient contact tracing. It also involves the use of contactless identification, reducing contact points, and facilitating contactless interactions. These measures help in minimizing contact and exposure, enabling swift contact tracing, case isolation, and notification, as well as enabling remote monitoring and proximity detection. Individuals associated with these Benenefits are likely part of a group focused on implementing strategies to limit and track contact in order to mitigate the transmission of contagious diseases in infrastructure environments, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods.
