## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various aspects related to the spread and transmission of contagious diseases, particularly in infrastructure and built environments. It includes factors such as the lack of understanding of disease transmission patterns, the shift in the range of diseases and hosts, limited consideration of mobility patterns and interactions in epidemiological models, spatial variations in disease spread, limitations of current crowd models in representing disease transmission mechanisms, and the negative physical effects of quarantine and social distancing. It also covers specific concerns like the spread of infections in crowded spaces, the uncertainty in epidemic modeling, the impact of contagious diseases in densely populated areas, the spread of coronavirus and other contagious epidemics, and the challenges in tracking and containing outbreaks. Other risks include high prevalence of diseases like HIV, unreliable prediction of pandemic evolution, inadequate preparedness and response planning for pandemics, vulnerabilities of buildings to pandemic spread, and the transmission of infectious particles in various settings. Overall, this category highlights the multitude of risks and challenges associated with the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure and the need for comprehensive preparedness and response strategies.
