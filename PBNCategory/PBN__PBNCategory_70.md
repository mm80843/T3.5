## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the various challenges and negative impacts associated with contagious diseases and their spread within infrastructure, specifically in green building neighborhoods. These risks include decreased in-person exposure to surgical education, disruptive educational activities for both children and adults, negative effects of sedentary behavior during quarantine and social isolation, fear and negative emotions, isolation and loneliness, temporary public panic, disruption of physical activity, musculoskeletal disorders, noise disturbances, impulsive adoption of extreme measures, decreased productivity, decreased morale, decreased public gatherings, concealment of mobility, disruption in material supply, restricted movement, delayed treatment, identifying symptomatic individuals, resistance to change, limited coordination across sub-populations, physical inactivity, stability of virus on surfaces, disrupted sleep, lack of face-to-face interaction, inadequate physical distancing, unconscious occupant behavior, non-compliance with mask mandates, exclusion of non-English speaking populations, incomplete models, unequal impacts on educational outcomes, frustration and boredom, and decreased concentrations of air pollutants. These risks encompass a wide range of factors including education, physical and mental health, social interaction, and adherence to guidelines, highlighting the complexity and multi-faceted nature of the challenges faced in green building neighborhoods during contagious disease outbreaks.
