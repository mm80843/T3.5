## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various issues related to monitoring, contact tracing, and testing in the context of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. These Risks include difficulties in monitoring mobility and contact tracing, such as a lack of monitoring and contact tracing capabilities, ineffective contact tracing processes, and limited awareness and interoperability. Additionally, there are concerns about the limited capacity for diagnostic testing, including low testing capacity, limited diagnostic tests, and slow testing processes. Other Risks involve disruptions to monitoring and surveillance systems, such as ICT service disruptions and automation disruptions, as well as limitations in surveillance measures and peer-review failures. Furthermore, there are challenges in detecting and diagnosing cases, with issues like incomplete detection, misdiagnosis, and equipment malfunctions. Overall, these Risks highlight the potential problems and limitations in monitoring, tracing, and testing in green building neighborhoods, which may affect the ability to effectively control and manage the spread of contagious diseases.
