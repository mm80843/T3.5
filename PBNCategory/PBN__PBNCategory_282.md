## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders represents individuals who are particularly susceptible to allergic reactions, respiratory conditions, weakened immune systems, chronic health conditions, or certain medical conditions. This includes allergy sufferers, especially those with respiratory conditions or allergies, individuals with weakened immune systems or respiratory conditions, the elderly and individuals with chronic conditions, patients with chronic conditions or respiratory and cardiovascular problems, individuals with immunosuppression and chronic low-grade inflammation, those with high disease burden, individuals with medical conditions and sensitivity to temperature, those with preexisting medical or substance use problems, vulnerable individuals such as children and people with respiratory conditions, and individuals with respiratory conditions. They may be especially vulnerable in areas with high infection rates or close proximity to potential infectors, particularly during flu seasons.
