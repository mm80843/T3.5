## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes strategies and measures implemented to improve the movement and flow of individuals within a certain space or infrastructure, with the aim of minimizing the risk of contamination. These interventions focus on analyzing and optimizing the paths and routes that users take, ensuring that there are no bottlenecks or congested areas where the spread of contagious diseases can occur. By organizing and managing user flows more efficiently, the likelihood of contamination is reduced, creating a safer environment for individuals within the designated space or infrastructure.
