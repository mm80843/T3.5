## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various challenges and issues related to the knowledge, development, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines. It includes factors such as lack of knowledge about the virus and its treatments, difficulty in vaccine distribution, unequal vaccine access, uncertainty and time-consuming research process for vaccines, incomplete vaccination data, disparities in vaccine access, lower vaccination rates among certain populations, limited storage capacity for vaccines, inefficient use of resources in the vaccination process, vaccine hesitancy, inadequate vaccination coverage, and reliance on herd immunity without proper control. Additionally, it encompasses risks related to the lack of preexisting immunities, inadequate availability of vaccines and agents-specific drugs, waning efficacy of vaccines, hesitation to vaccinate, higher risk of reinfection in unvaccinated individuals, and missing vaccination data. Individuals mentioned in this list may belong to the group facing these risks and challenges in the context of contagious diseases spread in green buildings neighbourhoods.
