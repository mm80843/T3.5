## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes a wide range of potential dangers and threats that can have an impact on human health, safety, and well-being, both individually and within a neighbourhood or community. These risks include physical health risks, psychological risks, and security risks, as well as risks related to cybersecurity, handling uncertainty, and risk perception. They encompass risks related to general health and safety, such as the risk of exposure in healthcare settings and safety risks for workers. These risks also include concerns about the spread of contagious diseases, such as the risk of workplace transmission and increased risk of sudden cardiac death or obesity. Additionally, risks related to communication and perception, such as risk communication strategy and biased risk perception, are included, as well as risks associated with economic and financial systems, such as insolvency risks and risk of loan defaults. Overall, this category of Risks encompasses a wide range of potential threats and dangers, highlighting the importance of addressing and mitigating these risks to protect individuals and communities from harm.
