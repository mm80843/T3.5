## Title of the category

This category of Technologys describes various aspects of urban planning and design strategies, including equitable urban planning and policies, adaptation of existing infrastructure, smart city technologies, digital platforms for urban governance, and contingency planning frameworks. It also includes geographic information systems (GIS) and their use in analyzing community needs, optimizing facility placement, and identifying areas with low access to urban green spaces. The Technologys in this list also encompass urban design principles and techniques, as well as space planning, zoning systems, and targeted investment in underserved neighborhoods. Overall, these Technologys relate to the optimization of urban spaces, the integration of green infrastructure, and the management of population density and distribution in urban areas.
