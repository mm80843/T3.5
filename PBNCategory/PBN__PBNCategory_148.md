## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a range of measures aimed at ensuring safety and protection in various contexts. These measures include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), implementation of safety protocols, and enforcement of safety regulations. They also involve providing education and training on safety measures, promoting worker safety, and ensuring access to safe drinking water. In addition, this category emphasizes the protection of vulnerable individuals and the implementation of measures to prevent the spread of contagious diseases, such as home isolation of suspect cases. These Mitigations also address the importance of maintaining physical distancing, using proper lighting for safety, and implementing physical barriers in spaces where necessary. Furthermore, they highlight the need for proper training and enforcement of safety practices, as well as the importance of psychological support for individuals affected by emergencies. This category of Mitigations also emphasizes the need for improved occupational safety, compliance with safety regulations, and the use of environmental-friendly protective equipment. Overall, these Mitigations aim to ensure the well-being and protection of individuals in various environments, promoting safety and minimizing the risk of contagion.
