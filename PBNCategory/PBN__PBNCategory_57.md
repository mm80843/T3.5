## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various challenges and issues related to construction and infrastructure in the context of contagious diseases, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods. These risks include a lack of understanding of social distancing measures on building occupant exposure, shortages of construction materials, higher costs of installation and maintenance, poor construction techniques and low-quality building materials, uncertainty in the construction market, inadequate pandemic preparedness in existing buildings, environmental impacts of construction during a pandemic, transportation challenges for construction workers, disruptions and delays in construction projects, environmental and financial impacts on the construction industry, resistance to new building systems and technologies, inefficiency in building systems and equipment, insufficient building regulations and codes, financial crisis in the construction industry, delays in delivery of construction materials, limited time for project delivery, inadequate energy modeling and high energy consumption in buildings, concerns about project time, cost, and scope, lack of incentives for building owners to invest in indoor environmental quality improvement, unbalanced utilization of buildings, challenges in building adaptation and design, health and safety risks for construction workers, and the creation of breeding sites through construction and demolition waste.
