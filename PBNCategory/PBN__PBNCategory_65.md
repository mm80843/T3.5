## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the potential dangers associated with the transmission and spread of contagious diseases, including vector-borne diseases transmitted through mosquitoes and ticks. It encompasses various factors such as the lack of knowledge and understanding of these diseases, the risk of rapid spread and cross-sectorial impact, the emergence of new diseases, and climate-associated diseases. It also includes risks related to airborne transmission of diseases, vulnerability to infection, delayed reporting of infectious diseases, increased prevalence of respiratory diseases, and the importation of diseases. Additionally, this category includes the potential for gnawing damage, which can contribute to the spread of diseases. Individuals in this list are likely to be involved in efforts to mitigate the risks and consequences of contagious diseases in infrastructure, including green buildings neighbourhoods.
