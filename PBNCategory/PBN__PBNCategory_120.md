## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes various measures and protocols aimed at reducing the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods. These include enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols, the use of disinfection systems such as the Surfacide multiple-emitter automated UV-C disinfection system, the replacement of stainless steel surfaces with copper coatings that have antimicrobial properties, and the application of antimicrobial coatings. Regular disinfection of indoor spaces, including air and surfaces, as well as regular cleaning and disinfection, are also emphasized. Other strategies mentioned include the use of robot-controlled non-contact UV surface disinfection, self-disinfecting surfaces, and the proper disposal and disinfection of hospital wastes and wastewater. The implementation of strict disinfection protocols, the use of UV-C light for disinfection, and the development of antimicrobial materials and coatings are also mentioned as effective measures. In addition, the use of bleach-soaked pads, UV light disinfection, and disinfectant fogging systems are suggested, as well as the strengthening of disinfection routines in wastewater and the development of continuously active antimicrobial coatings. The proper treatment and disinfection of water and wastewater systems, the use of high-performing filters, and the regular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces are further recommended. The implementation of air disinfection technologies, such as UVGI or photocatalytic oxidation, and the regular disinfection of shared tools and equipment are also highlighted. Additionally, the disinfection of shoe soles, masks, and floors, as well as the use of hygienic and antibacterial materials, are mentioned as effective strategies. Overall, this list of Mitigations represents a comprehensive set of measures to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in green buildings neighborhoods and ensure a safe and hygienic environment.
