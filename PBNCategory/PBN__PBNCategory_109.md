## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a range of actions and strategies aimed at improving public health and preventing the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure and green buildings neighborhoods. These measures include strengthening public health surveillance, implementing public health policies and interventions, promoting public health education and awareness, investing in healthcare infrastructure, improving access to healthcare services, and addressing social determinants of health. It also involves enhancing health education and communication through various channels, such as social media and online platforms, implementing self-health evaluation protocols, and increasing public health funding. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to prioritize public health over economic concerns, foster multi-sectoral collaboration, and strengthen international cooperation in public health. These measures aim to create healthier environments, reduce the risk of disease transmission, and ensure equitable access to healthcare and resources for vulnerable populations.
