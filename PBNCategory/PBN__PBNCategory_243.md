## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders represents a wide range of individuals and groups who are part of different communities. These communities can be local, urban, marginalized, disadvantaged, poor, vulnerable, affected, general, or rural. The Stakeholders within this category include individuals and communities, Taiwanese citizens and communities, climate change communicators, the scientific community, communication entities, digital health communities, the global community, the Openkg community, and telecommunications. This diverse group of stakeholders may have varying levels of access and resources, and they play important roles in addressing contagious diseases spread in infrastructure, particularly in green buildings neighborhoods.
