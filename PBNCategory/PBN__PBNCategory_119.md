## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes various measures that can be implemented to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, particularly in green building neighborhoods. These measures include enforcing social distancing and remote work, maintaining physical distance between workers, quarantining cities, implementing strict social distancing measures, reducing population density, utilizing smart city solutions for social distancing monitoring, implementing occupancy control and physical distancing rules, improving public transportation infrastructure to ensure physical distancing, redesigning interior spaces to accommodate for social distancing, implementing crowd control measures, promoting remote work, establishing occupancy limits and providing clear guidelines, promoting access to open green space while adhering to social distancing, developing new typologies for public spaces to describe social distancing and health risks, avoiding crowds, implementing temporary regulations to restrict gatherings, promoting social distancing in workplace design, enforcing social distancing for senior citizens, managing occupant density, promoting outdoor spaces, and implementing public awareness campaigns. These measures aim to reduce crowding, promote physical distancing, limit occupancy, and increase public awareness to mitigate the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods.
