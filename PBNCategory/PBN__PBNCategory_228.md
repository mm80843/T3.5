## Title of the category

This category of Interventions describes methods and systems used to track and monitor infections. These interventions involve collecting data on individuals who have contracted a contagious disease, typically within a green building neighborhood or community. The purpose is to carefully track the spread of infections and identify potential sources or patterns of transmission, allowing for timely and targeted response measures. Infection tracking/monitoring interventions utilize various techniques, such as contact tracing, testing protocols, surveillance systems, and data analysis, to effectively track the movement and transmission of contagious diseases within a specific population.
