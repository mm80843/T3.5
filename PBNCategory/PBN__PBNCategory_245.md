## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders describes a diverse group of individuals and organizations involved in various aspects of contagious diseases spread and response. It includes epidemiologists, pandemic areas, Taiwan CDC, malaria elimination programs, infection control teams, vaccine distributors, and quarantine facility operators. It also encompasses different populations such as individuals at risk, infected persons, those in quarantine or social isolation, patients with severe COVID-19, immunocompromised individuals, individuals with compromised immune function, and individuals with long COVID-19. Additionally, it includes individuals in close proximity to infected persons, individuals who come into contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces, individuals exposed to Far-UV-C light, and individuals living in provinces with high HIV prevalence. This category also covers specific groups like liver transplant recipients with metabolic comorbidities, vaccinated patients, reinfected patients with and without symptoms, individuals living alone or with limited social connections (including older adults), and patients receiving virtual care. Finally, it encompasses individuals seeking COVID-19 information and applications, people in areas with high virus prevalence, and those with limited diagnostic capacity.
