## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various issues related to water safety, water consumption, and waste management. It includes risks such as inadequate water safety practices (Wq1, Wq2), excessive water consumption (Wc1, Wc2), poor waste management practices (Wm1, Wm2, Wm3), and inadequate waste management systems (Wwm1, Wwm2, Wwm3). The individuals in this list are likely associated with or impacted by these risks, which could involve issues like contaminated water, high water usage, inefficient waste disposal, and improper handling of waste materials.
