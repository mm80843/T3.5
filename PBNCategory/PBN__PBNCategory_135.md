## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a wide range of measures that can be implemented in green buildings and their surrounding neighborhoods to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. These include training and education for workers, detailed planning and coordination of tasks, implementing flexible work schedules and transportation arrangements, maintaining physical distance, and providing effective guidance and training. Other mitigation strategies involve improving maintenance and management practices, implementing active and passive design strategies, and integrating and holistically planning processes. Additionally, there are suggestions for adjusting research design, implementing remote work and flexible schedules, and restructuring the workforce. The list also includes measures related to construction projects, such as off-site construction, simplified procedures, and the management of deliveries. Some mitigations focus on enhancing workplace rules and signage, while others highlight the importance of resource planning and predictive analytics. Overall, these mitigations aim to ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals in green building neighborhoods, by addressing various aspects of their daily lives and creating a resilient and adaptable environment.
