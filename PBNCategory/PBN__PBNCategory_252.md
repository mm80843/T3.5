## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders describes individuals who are particularly vulnerable to contagious diseases, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare and education. This includes those with low income or low education, specifically men, those living in affected areas, those in noisy or poorly ventilated environments such as offices or crowded buildings, and those living in areas with high mosquito populations. Additionally, individuals in lockdown areas, crowded or underserved areas, and occupied public settings are at higher risk. Other vulnerable groups include those living in small apartments or poorly lit areas, individuals who work in visually demanding tasks or noisy environments, and those who relied on gyms or public spaces for exercise. Poor hygiene practices and unsanitary conditions also contribute to increased vulnerability, as well as individuals living in flats or spaces with high occupancy rates.
