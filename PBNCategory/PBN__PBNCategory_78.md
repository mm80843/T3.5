## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes a range of issues related to the lack, insufficiency, or inadequacy of various resources and measures in dealing with contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. These risks include the lack of resources in disease surveillance, patient education, and drug development, as well as the lack of awareness and coordination. Additionally, it highlights the shortage of qualified staff for sample collection and testing, the inadequacy of facilities and negative pressure, and the lack of physical activity opportunities. These risks also encompass difficulties faced by orthopedic patients, lack of effective treatment and recovery support, inadequate patient-centered care, and insufficient acoustics and working conditions. Furthermore, it addresses the lack of hand hygiene, emergency preparedness, running water, drugs density, epidemiological knowledge, and evaluative planning. Other risks involve the shortage of critical supplies, containment failures, ineffective dissemination, lack of quick and accurate diagnostics, credibility, legislation, and difficulties in management. Moreover, it includes delays and lack of effective drug development, insufficient non-pharmaceutical interventions, inefficient medication delivery, inadequate hygiene, lack of coverage, and ineffective non-pharmaceutical interventions. The risks further extend to the absence of efficacy studies, lack of reporting, inadequate maintenance of urban green spaces (UGS), lack of physical barriers, lack of regulation, poor personal hygiene, staff sickness and self-isolation, lack of willingness to pay for health emergency measures, inefficient pain management, unnecessary standby loads, lack of proper training, lack of anterooms, ineffective signage, lack of deterrence, potential lack of coverage, lack of agility, and lack of information about recoveries.
