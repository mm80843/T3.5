## Title of the category

This category of Themes describes the various stages and experiences an individual goes through when interacting with a product, service, or system. It includes understanding the user's needs, expectations, and goals, as well as their motivations and behaviors when using the product or service. The User journey encompasses the entire process, from initial awareness and consideration, through engagement and interaction, to eventual decision-making and post-experience evaluation. It allows designers and researchers to gain a holistic understanding of how users navigate and interact with a particular system, and helps identify opportunities for improvement and optimization.
