## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a range of strategies and actions aimed at promoting and facilitating physical activity within the community, especially in green buildings neighbourhoods. It includes the use and promotion of television and social media-based exercise programs, virtual reality-based training, correlating health issues with movement patterns, incorporating exercise opportunities in building design, providing spaces for physical activities, promoting physical activity in greenspaces, encouraging and providing resources for individuals to engage in regular physical activity at home or in limited outdoor spaces, climbing stairs, engaging in daily tasks and activities, provision of guidelines on safe physical activity outdoors, promoting alternative forms of exercise, promoting home-based exercise programs with the use of fitness apps and online resources, robotics in healthcare, monitoring physical exercise, comparative research on exercise behaviors, muscle strengthening exercises, yoga, learning new physical skills, virtual exercise classes, adapting exercise intensity and volume, reducing physical contact, promoting a balanced approach to non-contact interaction activities, and avoiding physical activity during viral infection. These Mitigations are aimed at improving physical well-being, enhancing self-sufficiency in recreational facilities, providing pain management and psychological treatment through virtual reality, and promoting alternative means for individuals to connect with nature.
