## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the various factors that can contribute to the spread and impact of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. These risks encompass a range of issues such as lack of occupant exposure modeling, information asymmetry between occupants and indoor environmental data, environmental degradation, lack of natural outdoor environment, poor environmental quality, minimization of the number of people in indoor environments, lack of environmental precautions and controls, inadequate self-sufficient living spaces, poor spatial organization, overreliance on artificial lighting and ventilation, inadequate natural lighting, variation in lighting standards, lack of nature exposure, indoor pollutants, inadequate thermal comfort, excessive noise levels, poor housing quality, inadequate public space design, inequities and exclusions in public space design, limited space and room quality, inadequate water supply, occupancy density, inadequate housing layout and facility design, raised indoor temperature and humidity, negative consequences on indoor climate, ambient pollutants, inadequate housing automation and internet connectivity, lack of housing hygiene, low residential density, inadequate room selection, lack of communication and surveillance capabilities in makeshift hospitals, ineffective home isolation, impact on informal street economy, lack of monitoring of indoor environmental quality, limited room functionality, insufficient bedroom design, underestimation of urban green spaces in environmental management, inadequate temperature screening, inaccessible built environment, inadequate implementation of environmental adjustments, inadequate circadian regulation in bedrooms, lack of spatial variety and privacy, limited access to nature and fresh air, inadequate unit sizes and layouts for physical distancing, rent burden, lack of sunlight and fresh air, lack of proper ergonomic setup in home offices, mold growth and poor indoor air quality, decreased emphasis on personal and environmental hygiene, and the dynamic nature of the environment. Individuals in this list are likely to be residents or occupants of green buildings and neighborhoods that are at risk of experiencing these issues and may face challenges related to contagious diseases spread and overall health and well-being.
