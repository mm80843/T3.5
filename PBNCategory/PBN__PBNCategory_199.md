## Title of the category

This category of Technologys describes a range of methods and solutions for controlling and preventing the spread of contagious diseases, specifically focused on mosquitos and malaria. It includes the use of anti-malaria drugs, mosquito control operations, conservation methods, mosquito traps and surveillance, spraying equipment, entomological surveillance, bird deterrent devices, larvicide treatments, climate change mitigation techniques, genetic manipulation of mosquitoes, mosquito-resistant alternative building materials, pest control measures, auto-dissemination of insecticides, toxic baited sugar traps, insecticides and pesticides, development of new insecticides, insecticide-treated screens and bed nets, integrated pest management, planting insect-pollinated plants, trapping methods, investigation of mosquito-resistant building materials through material science, introduction of Wolbachia bacteria into mosquitoes, and controlling allergic potential of exotic species. Individuals involved in any of these technologies are likely to be working towards preventing the spread of contagious diseases, particularly those transmitted by mosquitos, and finding innovative ways to mitigate the impact of these diseases on human populations.
