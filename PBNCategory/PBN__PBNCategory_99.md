## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various challenges and vulnerabilities related to the spread and management of contagious diseases, specifically in green building neighborhoods. These risks include the possibility of cascading disruptions, where the domino effect of one incident can lead to further disruptions within the community. There may be difficulties in identifying cases in a timely manner, which can hinder timely intervention and control measures. The high number of undetected cases, including asymptomatic individuals, poses additional challenges in surveillance and containment efforts. There may be insufficient monitoring and reporting of asymptomatic and unreported cases, which can further amplify the transmission of the disease. Under-reporting and under-notification of cases, including instances of importation and introduction of new cases, contribute to a lack of accurate data and potential underestimation of the true extent of the outbreak. Finally, the occurrence of reinfection cases raises concerns about the effectiveness and duration of immunity, further complicating disease control strategies.
