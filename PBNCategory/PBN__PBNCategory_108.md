## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes various measures aimed at promoting the availability, accessibility, and quality of green spaces in urban environments. This includes preserving and developing forests and other green spaces, planning and designing open-air spaces, creating smaller neighborhood green spaces, and upgrading and maintaining urban green spaces. It also includes incorporating nature into living spaces, providing access to nature and green spaces, and promoting the availability and affordability of housing with private green spaces. Additionally, this category includes measures related to outdoor spaces, such as designing outdoor activity spaces, ensuring the availability of outdoor spaces, and improving their quality. Other measures involve adjusting indoor spaces, providing common building spaces, and ensuring the availability of private spaces. Furthermore, this category encompasses measures related to the spacing and distribution of green spaces, including increasing distance between spaces, redistributing green spaces, and ensuring proximity to urban green spaces. Finally, it includes measures related to the maintenance and care of green spaces, such as implementing regular maintenance plans and ensuring proper care and upkeep.
