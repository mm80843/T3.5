## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a variety of measures related to testing for contagious diseases. It includes the standardization and verification of PCR methods and protocols, the use of nested PCR assays, combination testing methods with biomarker measurements, and universal asymptomatic testing. Other measures include the implementation of regular testing, contact tracing, and isolation, as well as widespread testing and contact tracing. It also encompasses the use of standardized signage, voluntary testing, free testing, and improved testing methods. Additional measures include the development of rapid diagnostic tests, the use of wastewater-based testing, and the testing of respiratory and stool specimens. The category emphasizes the importance of increasing testing capacity, developing accurate and rapid test kits, and prioritizing testing for vulnerable populations. It also suggests the use of artificial intelligence technology for cost-effective tests and the implementation of digital tools for contact tracing. Overall, this category of Mitigations highlights the significance of testing as a key strategy in controlling the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods.
