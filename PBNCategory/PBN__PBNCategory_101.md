## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes measures and actions to prevent and control the spread of contagious diseases, specifically in green building neighborhoods. These include monitoring methods for virus detection in wastewater and monitoring changes in RNA concentration over time for early intervention. It also involves developing efficient virus concentration methods, implementing infection control measures, and improving virus quantification and recovery of infected patients. Other actions include the development of antiviral coatings and technologies, implementing wastewater-based surveillance systems, and conducting research on virus behavior and characteristics. Additionally, it includes measures such as contact tracing, isolation of infected individuals, remote monitoring of patients, and the use of wearable devices for detection. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of data collection, modeling, and forecasting of virus spread, as well as the development of standardized protocols for testing and detection. These Mitigations aim to control outbreaks, protect public health, and ensure the robustness and safety of green building neighborhoods in the face of contagious diseases.
