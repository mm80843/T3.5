## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various disruptions and imbalances in global and national supply chains, including supply chain disruptions, disruptions of global settlement systems, shortages in supply chains, obstacles in production or transportation, and lack of supply chain visibility. These risks can negatively impact various industries such as the petroleum and oil industry, food industry, and energy supply chains. The individuals in this list may be experts or stakeholders involved in supply chain management, global value chains, or those affected by the lack of redundancy and complexity within supply chains.
