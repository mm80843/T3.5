## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various challenges and issues related to healthcare systems and infrastructure. These risks include the overloading and overwhelming of healthcare facilities, the strain and vulnerability of health systems, limited access to healthcare services and facilities, shortages of healthcare personnel, equipment, and medication, healthcare disparities and inequalities, collapse of health services, inadequate healthcare response, and the disruption of core clinical services. The individuals in the list are likely involved in or affected by the healthcare industry, including healthcare professionals, policymakers, researchers, and patients. They may be experiencing or studying the challenges and consequences of these risks in healthcare systems, including the impact on patient care, resource burden, financial implications, and the need for improved infrastructure and preparedness.
