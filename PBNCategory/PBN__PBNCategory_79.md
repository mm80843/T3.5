## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various ways in which individuals can be exposed to and spread contagious diseases through contaminated surfaces. These Risks include the spread of covid-19 through contaminated surfaces, exposure to chemical and biological contaminants on stainless steel surfaces, inadequate antibacterial and antiviral properties of stainless steel surfaces, contamination of frequently touched surfaces, transmission via contaminated surfaces, contamination of floor and object surfaces, recontamination of surfaces, contamination through close contact and airborne transmission of infectious microorganisms indoors. It also includes the risk of contamination from respiratory droplets, survival of pathogens in the air, contamination of fomites (objects or materials likely to carry infection), contamination from deliveries, toxicity of nanomaterials, contamination of personal protective equipment, disease transmission through contaminated hands, contamination of blood products, contamination of HVAC systems, contaminated tools and surfaces in public transport, and contaminated shoe soles. These Risks highlight the importance of maintaining clean and disinfected surfaces to prevent the spread of contagious diseases within green building neighborhoods.
