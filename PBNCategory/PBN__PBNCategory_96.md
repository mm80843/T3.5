## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various issues related to the use of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) systems in preventing the spread of contagious diseases. These risks include occupational exposure to the coronavirus, lack of standardized tests and protocols for UVGI efficacy and testing, the requirement for proper usage and maintenance of UVGI systems, and the need for careful design and installation to ensure efficacy. Other risks involve the decrease in effectiveness of UVGI with increasing humidity, potential health risks if UVGI systems are not properly installed and maintained, and the limited evidence on the ability of UVGI systems to prevent healthcare-associated infections, such as surgical site infections and tuberculosis transmission. There are also concerns about limited awareness and expertise in germicidal UV technology, harmful effects of UV-C light on humans if not properly shielded, and the safety of far-UVC light exposure. In addition, the risks include the potential health risks of UV-C radiation exposure, inadequate sunlight exposure, and the inconvenience and cost of mask filters in smart face masks. Overall, individuals in this list are associated with risks related to the use, effectiveness, maintenance, and potential health hazards of UVGI systems in preventing the spread of contagious diseases in green buildings and healthcare facilities.
