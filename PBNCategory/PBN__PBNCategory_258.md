## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders describes a wide range of individuals and organizations involved in the design, construction, operation, and occupancy of buildings. It includes building managers, owners, and facility managers who are responsible for the day-to-day management and maintenance of the building. Building designers, architects, and interior designers are involved in the planning and design of the building to ensure it meets the needs of occupants. Construction industry stakeholders, including construction professionals, construction workers, and builders, are involved in the actual construction of the building. Building occupants, including both residential and commercial occupants, play a crucial role as they live or work in the building and are directly affected by its design and operation. Building regulators and surveyors ensure that buildings meet regulatory and safety standards. This category also includes individuals responsible for building maintenance and operations, as well as those involved in building retrofitting and energy efficiency improvements. Overall, these Stakeholders represent the different roles and responsibilities involved in the life cycle of a building, from design to occupancy, and highlight the importance of collaboration and coordination among these different actors for the successful and sustainable operation of a green building neighborhood.
