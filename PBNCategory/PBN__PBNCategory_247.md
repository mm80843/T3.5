## Title of the category

This category of Stakeholders represents various groups of people or animals that are affected by contagious diseases in infrastructure, specifically in green building neighbourhoods. These groups include vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with underlying health conditions, as well as low-income or marginalized populations who may have limited access to healthcare and resources. The general population, global population, societal population, and urban populations are also included, representing the larger community that may be at risk of disease spread. Specific populations, at-risk populations, minority populations, indigenous populations, migrant populations, and disadvantaged populations are all subsets of the general population that may have unique challenges and vulnerabilities in the face of contagious diseases. Wildlife populations, including both urban and non-urban wildlife, are also considered stakeholders as they can be vectors for disease transmission. Additionally, quarantined populations, underserved populations, homeless populations, and the younger population are all specific groups that may require special attention and support. Overall, this category of Stakeholders encompasses a wide range of individuals and groups who are affected by contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods.
