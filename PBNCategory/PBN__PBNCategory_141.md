## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes a range of measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure, specifically in green buildings neighbourhoods. These measures include wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, maintaining good hand hygiene, and implementing contact tracing and testing. They also involve promoting the use of face masks, enforcing mask-wearing rules, and mandating their usage in certain settings or situations. Additionally, it includes the implementation of strict protocols for hygiene, sanitation, and ventilation, as well as promoting alternative modes of transportation to reduce the risk of transmission. Other measures mentioned in this category include promoting respiratory hygiene, improving translation accuracy of speech-transcribing face masks, and using eye protection. By adhering to these various mitigations, individuals can help reduce the spread of contagious diseases and contribute to the overall safety and well-being of their community.
