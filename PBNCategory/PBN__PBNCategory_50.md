## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various aspects related to the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The risks include the spread of the virus in hospitals, through the air, through droplets, and through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. It also highlights the transmission of the virus through aerosols, sewage, and respiratory droplets. Other risks include the persistence of the virus on surfaces, exposure to the virus, and the potential for uncontrolled transmission. Additionally, it mentions the risk of resistance development to anti-SARS-CoV-2 coatings, as well as the potential adverse effects or ineffectiveness of such coatings. The stability and decay rate of the virus in the environment, as well as its inactivation in water, are also discussed. Lastly, the category highlights the uncertainties surrounding the origin of the virus and the challenges in its removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants.
