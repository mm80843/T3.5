## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes various modes of transmission and factors related to the spread of contagious diseases in different settings. It includes risks associated with airborne transmission through aerosols, respiratory droplets, and fomites, as well as transmission via close contact and person-to-person contact. These risks can occur in public spaces, gatherings, buildings, and communities, and may affect attendees, colleagues, and students/staff. The list also addresses transmission in poorly ventilated rooms, during patient care, and with specific bodily fluids such as saliva, urine, and anal secretions. Additionally, it highlights the impact of confounding factors, economic considerations, and the potential for transmission rebound after easing interventions. This category encompasses a wide range of risks related to contagious transmission, offering insights into their diverse impacts and contexts.
