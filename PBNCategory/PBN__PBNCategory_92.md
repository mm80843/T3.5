## Title of the category

This category of Risks describes the potential dangers related to virus propagation within green building neighborhoods. The risks, referred to as Pvp1 to Pvp6, highlight the possibility of viruses spreading and infecting individuals in the identified group. However, this list also includes risks related to personal comfort (Pc1 to Pc4), such as inadequate heating or cooling systems, as well as risks related to local services (Lc1 and Lc2) provided in the area. Additionally, there are risks associated with water quality (Wq1 and Wq2), water contamination (Wc1 and Wc2), and air quality (Aq1, Aq2, and Aq4) which have the potential to impact the health and well-being of individuals residing in these neighborhoods. Finally, the list includes risks related to local services (Ls1 and Ls2) that may be insufficient or lacking.
