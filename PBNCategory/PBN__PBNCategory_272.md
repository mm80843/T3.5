## Title of the category

This category of stakeholders describes individuals who are present or working in crowded, public, confined, or enclosed spaces, particularly indoors. It includes visitors, workers, and occupants of indoor spaces, especially those that are poorly ventilated, dimly lit, or have high traffic. These stakeholders may be at a higher risk of spreading or contracting contagious diseases in these types of environments.
