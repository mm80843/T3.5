## Title of the category

This category of Mitigations describes measures to monitor and control temperature and humidity levels in green buildings. It includes the use of digital thermometers, temperature checks, and robot-assisted temperature measurement. The goal is to maintain optimal thermal environments and ensure thermal comfort for occupants. Mitigations also focus on improving insulation and heating systems, optimizing HVAC systems, and providing individual temperature control options. There is an emphasis on energy-efficient measures and climate change mitigation. The category also includes measures to control humidity, such as monitoring and adjusting indoor humidity levels. Additionally, other mitigation strategies involve implementing efficient HVAC systems, regular maintenance, and the use of thermal imaging for temperature screening. Overall, the goal is to create a comfortable and healthy indoor climate while considering energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.
