>A:
The different vectors of contagious diseases in cities include:

1. Mosquitoes: Mosquitoes are the most common vectors of contagious diseases in urban areas. Species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are responsible for spreading diseases like dengue fever, Zika virus, chikungunya, and yellow fever. These mosquitoes breed in manmade containers like tires, pots, and water storage containers.

2. Triatomine bugs: Triatomine bugs, also known as kissing bugs, transmit Chagas disease. They are commonly found in urban areas, especially in houses with poor housing quality and land tenure security.

3. Ticks: Ticks are vectors for diseases like Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. While they are more commonly associated with rural areas, ticks can also be found in urban parks and green spaces where they can come into contact with humans.

4. Sandflies: Sandflies transmit diseases such as leishmaniasis. They are usually found in areas with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions, which are common in urban slums.

5. Black flies: Black flies are vectors for diseases like onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. They are typically found near bodies of water, including urban rivers and streams.

6. Tsetse flies: Tsetse flies transmit African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. While they are more commonly found in rural areas, they can also be present in urban areas near livestock and wildlife populations.

7. Fleas: Fleas can transmit diseases such as plague and murine typhus. They are commonly associated with rodents, which can be found in urban areas.

8. Aquatic snails: Aquatic snails are vectors for diseases like schistosomiasis. They are found in bodies of water, including urban lakes, ponds, and canals.

It's important to note that the prevalence and distribution of these vectors can vary depending on the specific city and its environmental conditions.
