The urban mosquitos Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus that spread dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya proliferate in manmade containers, such as tyres, pots and water storage containers\\n. These vectors proliferate in long occupied urban spaces where impoverished people live in crowded conditions; major epidemics of dengue continue to occur in the Favelas of Latin America\\n.\\nThe exact ways in which urbanization and vector densities interact vary. Levy et al.\\nexplored changes in the built environment of a major city in Peru, and found that Chagas disease (influenced by housing quality) was most prevalent among older (and slightly more wealthy) sections of the city due to land tenure security, which drove residents to invest more in their housing and perpetuate Triatoma infestans colonies. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), generally a rural zoonotic disease, has now spread to urban centers in Brazil through ruralurban human migration\\n. In contrast, models of malaria and dengue that account for climate and economic development have shown general decreases in distribution by 2050 due to increased socio-economic development trends, including better housing, piped water access, air conditioning, improved health outreach services and other factors\\n. This optimistic outlook may hide differential economic prosperity; whether such changes will occur among urban slum communities remains unclear.\\nPopulation movement and conflict\\nMigration, population growth and conflict will also continue to affect VBD', metadata={'article': 'bardosh_addressing_2017'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. A range of mosquitoes, sandflies, ticks, triatomine bugs, tsetse flies, fleas, black flies, aquatic snails, and other vectors are implicated. Many are zoonotic, or are at least influenced by livestock and wildlife populations. Their health consequences and disease ecologies are diverse, making generalizations difficult. However, most disproportionately impact people in tropical climates with inadequate access to health services, poor housing, weak governance structures, and socio-economic underdevelopment. While they can cause major epidemics that impact regional economic productivity, they also enact a quieter \"hidden\" endemic toll on local communities, perpetuating poverty, disability, malnutrition and social isolation.\\nOver the last two decades, major progress has been made in tackling the burden of VBDsfor example, with malaria\\nalthough progress has not been evenly distributed across the world, or across all diseases. Looking to the future, a spectrum of global challenges will influence, for better or worse, these epidemiological and programmatic trends. Understanding how this will occur, and with what consequences, needs to transcend simplistic perspectives to account for the complex interactions between hosts, pathogens, vectors, humans and environments. Emerging VBDs, such as Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIK), have recently infected millions. First identified in a rhesus monkey in 1947 along the shores of Lake Victoria, ZIKV has been linked to thousands of cases of microcephaly in Latin America and the Caribbean, and other neurological and developmental disorders in infants\\n. Other unknown infections will certainly emerge in the future; there are at least 500 known arthropod-borne viruses circulating in nature', metadata={'article': 'bardosh_addressing_2017'}),\n",

For example, the recent spread of Zika virus in low-and middle-income countries has been facilitated by urban crowding and poor housing in conjunction with a lack of running water, inadequate water storage, poor surface water drainage and waste management. The spike in Zika-related microcephaly cases concentrated in the poor and underdeveloped north-east of Brazil has been one of its most unfortunate outcomes. UN-Habitat, as the agency for sustainable urban development seeks to influence the growth of cities through improved urban planning and provision of appropriate infrastructure. It also has the tools and experience to enhance the capacity of local governments and communities in emergency contexts to upgrade basic services to reduce transmission of VBDs, compliment other medical interventions and facilitate surveillance and mosquito (and other vector) control.\\nPrevious experiences in mitigating epidemics show that community participation is critical. In particular, lessons can be drawn from decades of efforts to reduce the spread of the dengue virus. People are more likely to support control policies and adopt preventative measures when they are involved.

While certain species certainly maintain a dominant role in disease ecology, vector distributions will be shaped by the ways that temperature and precipitation differentially influence vector physiology, preference for different hosts and biting rates\\n.

       " Document(page_content='Conclusions\\nThe importance of resilient global health systems to deal with vector-borne infections, and indeed most other human health threats, is truly a matter of life and death. There is little doubt that the spectrum of social, environmental and climatic changes occurring simultaneously in the twenty-first century will impact the distribution and incidence of VBDs. The specifics of how, where, when and why this will occur will vary greatly by disease, region, locality and social group. Uncertainties remain high, and current modeling efforts offer only limited applicability for policy design and programmatic orientation. In summary, vectors and pathogens change and adapt much quicker than scientific knowledge and, as history has shown, the systems of public health governance that preclude effective response.\\nWhile this generalization may be true, there are important pathways to strengthen resilience and adaptation to future VBD scenarios. Through concrete examples, this paper has emphasized the importance of taking a community-based approach and discussed a wide range of issuesfrom local knowledge, multidisciplinarity, integrated strategies, community participation, social difference, co-infection, and institutional dynamicsthat should now be better incorporated. In light of the substantial commitments made at the Paris Agreement during the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 21) and the renewed global movement to end poverty manifest in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), now is the time to incorporate such an agenda within national adaptation policies and public health agendas. Doing so is paramount for the effective mitigation of future VBD spread in both urban and rural populations worldwide. Zika virus is stark reminder of this important need.', metadata={'article': 'bardosh_addressing_2017'}),\n",

In a world of flux, people, goods and vehicles are constantly in motion across borders and seas. Trade and travel translocate vectors and pathogens to new areas. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, current geopolitical conflicts (in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan, Nigeria and elsewhere) have caused the highest number of internally displaced persons and refugees since the Second World War, estimated at 60 million. This number is unlikely to be reduced soon, as climate change (floods, storms, landslides, and sea level rises), desertification and population growth maintain insecurity and drive migration of so-called 'climate refugees'\\n.\\nNatural disasters and armed conflict disrupt existing medical services and outreach, while also contributing to landscape changes\\n. In Uganda, cattle restocking after decades of military conflict drove an epidemic of sleeping sickness in disease-free areas\\n. Outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported in conflict regions of Afghanistan, among both civilians and army personnel\\n.\\nHuman movement between low-and high-risk areas is also important. In the Greater Mekong sub-Region, where artemisinin-resistant malaria has emerged, an extensive system of dams, planned in the region, are predicted to drive future migrations that will perpetuate malaria transmission\\n.

A successful means for increasing contagious proxies to a big population proportion is waterborne transmission. There are various water-associated mechanisms of transmitting communicable infections. It is reported that huge amounts of enteric microbes can be released into the water environments through the discharge of the wastes of infected people (solid or liquid) into exposed watercourses\\n. Secondly, infectious particles from confined-to-bed infected people may play a role in the transmissions of waterborne infections because pathogens in contaminated clothing and bedding may also be released into waterways in the laundry activity course\\n.\\nSurface or Contract Transmission', metadata={'article': 'amran_review_2022'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='From Valdez-Tah et al.\\nFrom the perspective of understanding immunology of infectious disease, there is a growing literature documenting the complex interactive responses of distinct pathogens in a common host\\n. Failure to take account of such interactions, whether they have negative or even positive consequences for the host, can lead to inadequate clinical care, incorrect assessment of the burden of disease at the community, district, and national levels, and erroneous epidemiological projections based on mathematical modeling of disease transmission. Furthermore, the emphasis of both malaria and lymphatic filariasis controlconsidered separatelyis currently focused on diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of infected human cases. If consideration were being given to the fact that the same vectors are transmitting both diseases, frequently in the same places, much more attention would be given to integrated vector managementan approach that remains relatively marginal in current global policy circles\\n. Furthermore, from the perspective of climate change projections, the more intricate ecosystem structures that are needed to describe risk of multiple VBDs are not appropriately tuned to realities that are likely to manifest themselves in the future. It is important that we base our understanding of disease patterns, and disease prioritization, on local epidemiological dynamics; Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) show great promise to provide such actionable intelligence (Table\\n).\\nIn addition, the contemporary heavy focus on pharmacological interventions and simultaneous limited attention to environmental management could change considerably in response to disease reporting at the community level.
