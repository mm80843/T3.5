## Short summary of the article

This paper provides a summary of key considerations for protecting informal urban settlements from the impacts of COVID-19. Informal settlements, which are characterized by limited access to basic services and high population density, face unique challenges in implementing control measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The vulnerabilities of these settlements include limited access to water, sanitation, and healthcare, as well as inadequate housing conditions. Additionally, the livelihoods of residents in informal settlements are often precarious, making it difficult for them to comply with social distancing measures. The paper highlights the need for locally-led responses that take into account the specific contexts and challenges faced by informal settlements. Local organizations and community groups are well-positioned to develop and implement strategies tailored to their communities. Collaborative efforts between local governments, community groups, and humanitarian agencies are crucial to ensure effective responses and support for informal settlements during the pandemic. The paper also emphasizes the importance of addressing poverty and inequality in order to reduce vulnerability and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in informal settlements.

## Summary of the article

There are many challenges in protecting informal urban settlements from COVID-19. These settlements, also known as slums, have a high population density and limited access to basic services like water and sanitation. This makes it difficult for people to follow advice on social distancing and handwashing. In addition, these settlements often face poverty and inequality, which makes it harder for people to protect themselves from the virus. Local organizations and community groups are important in developing strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in these settlements. It is also crucial to provide support and resources to these communities, including access to basic services, financial assistance, and protective equipment.
