## Short summary of the article

This study examines the relationship between climatic conditions and the spread of COVID-19, controlling for various confounding factors. The analysis uses global data and includes variables such as latitude, air travel, vehicle concentration, urbanization, testing intensity, cell phone usage, health expenditure, old-age dependency ratio, and income. The results indicate that countries located farther from the equator have a higher prevalence of COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants. The regression analysis shows that an increase in latitude by one degree is associated with a 4.3% increase in the prevalence of COVID-19. The findings suggest that higher temperatures and more intense UV radiation during summer may support public health measures to control the spread of the virus. However, it is emphasized that the disease will not vanish in summer, and effective public health measures are still necessary. The study has limitations, including the unclear mechanisms behind the relationship between climatic factors and transmission and the inclusion of only a subset of countries in the analysis. Future research should explore the effects of climatic factors, geographic factors, and human behavior on the transmission of the virus.

## Summary of the article

Scientists have been studying the relationship between temperature and the spread of COVID-19. Some studies have found that higher temperatures can reduce the spread of the virus, while others have found no association. To understand this better, researchers looked at data from different countries and found that countries farther from the equator (closer to the North or South Pole) tend to have more COVID-19 cases. The data also showed that an increase in distance from the equator by one degree of latitude is associated with a 4.3% increase in COVID-19 cases per million people. However, it's important to note that higher temperatures in the summer do not mean the disease will go away completely, and we still need to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.
