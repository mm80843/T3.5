## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a paper that introduces an R package called nCov2019, which provides access to real-time epidemiological data on the COVID-19 outbreak. The package aggregates data from four different sources, including official data from Chinese provincial health agencies, the World Health Organization, and public health agencies in other countries. It offers detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and over 500 Chinese cities. The package also includes functionalities for data visualization, allowing users to easily plot the distribution of cases on maps and create animations to understand disease transmission. Interactive web apps in both English and Chinese are also developed for users to access the datasets and gain insights without coding. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the package and apps through visualizations and forecasting models. It concludes that these tools can aid researchers, scientists, and public health officials in studying and managing the COVID-19 outbreak globally.

## Summary of the article

There is a new tool called nCov2019 that helps scientists and public health officials get real-time data on the COVID-19 outbreak. It collects information from different sources and keeps it updated throughout the day. With this tool, people can see the number of confirmed cases and deaths in different places around the world. It also has features that help visualize the data on maps and create animations to see how the disease is spreading. This tool is really helpful for researchers studying the virus and for people who want to understand what's happening with the outbreak.
