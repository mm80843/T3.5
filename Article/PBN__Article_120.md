## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on office buildings and workplaces. The abstract highlights the global economic decline, the challenges in public health, and the spread of the virus through different modes of transmission. It also emphasizes the need for regulations and guidelines to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in workplaces, as well as the importance of implementing protective and preventive measures in office buildings. The abstract mentions the need for ventilation systems, physical distancing, and touch-free technologies as engineering control measures. It also emphasizes the role of administrative and organizational control measures, such as workplace safety measures, cleaning and disinfection, emergency plans, and education and communication. The abstract concludes by stating that resilient office buildings with safety assurances are needed for workers to return to their workplaces amidst the ongoing pandemic.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people got sick and many people died. It was a very serious and scary time for everyone. The virus that caused COVID-19 could be spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Because of this, many workplaces had to close and people had to work from home. But now, as we are starting to reopen, we need to make sure that our offices and workplaces are safe from the virus. This means following rules and guidelines from health organizations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We also need to make changes to our buildings, like improving ventilation systems and having less close contact between people. It's important that we do everything we can to keep workers safe from the virus so that everyone can go back to work and our economies can start to recover.
