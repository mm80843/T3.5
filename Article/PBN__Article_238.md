## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that examines the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment. The study finds both positive and negative effects on the environment. Positive effects include improvements in air quality, clean beaches, and reduced environmental noise due to reduced human activity. The study shows that social distancing measures and reduced economic activity have led to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in countries such as China and Europe. However, the study also highlights negative effects, such as increased waste generation, including organic waste from online food ordering and medical waste. The study also notes a reduction in waste recycling programs in some countries due to concerns about the spread of the virus. The authors conclude that while there are some positive impacts on the environment, the negative effects may be greater, and the short-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is not a sustainable solution for long-term environmental cleanup. The study emphasizes the need for long-term structural changes in economies and proper waste management during the pandemic.

## Summary of the article

The new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV2, has had both positive and negative effects on the environment. On the positive side, there has been a decrease in air pollution and cleaner beaches. This is because people have been staying at home and not driving or traveling as much. This has also led to a reduction in noise levels in cities. However, there are also negative effects. There has been an increase in waste, both from online shopping and medical waste. Some countries have even stopped recycling because of concerns about the virus. Overall, while there have been some good changes, the virus is still causing problems for the environment.
