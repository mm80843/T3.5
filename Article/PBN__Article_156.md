## Short summary of the article

This article examines how the European Union (EU) and its Member States' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020 could inform climate action in Europe, particularly the implementation of the European Green Deal (EGD). The EGD, announced in December 2019, aims to make Europe a carbon-neutral continent by 2050. The article assesses the EU's public health and economic responses to COVID-19 and highlights the need for greater integration and stronger EU-level institutions in managing crises. It also discusses the challenges and successes of national responses to the pandemic, which provide lessons for a strong and coherent European response to the climate crisis. The EGD targets significant carbon emissions reductions by 2030, integrates existing environmental policies, and proposes a Just Transition Fund to support carbon-dependent member states in transitioning to renewable energy sources. However, the EGD has been met with both support and criticism, with concerns about its funding and the need for more ambitious targets. The article also examines the political challenges faced by the EGD, such as disagreements over corona bonds and the economic recovery fund. It discusses Hungary's approach to COVID-19, where the government used the crisis to consolidate authoritarian powers. The EU's global response to COVID-19, through initiatives like "Team Europe," is also examined, emphasizing the need for a coordinated multilateral approach. The article concludes that the EU's response to COVID-19 can inform the implementation of the EGD, but challenges such as national politics, funding, and global dynamics need to be addressed for successful climate action.

## Summary of the article

The European Green Deal (EGD) is a plan by the European Union (EU) to combat climate change and become a carbon-neutral continent by 2050. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the progress of the EGD. The EU's response to COVID-19 has shown that stronger EU-level institutions and coordinated action are needed to deal with crises effectively. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of public health and economic responses, which can inform future climate action. There are challenges in implementing the EGD, such as funding and disagreements among Member States, but there is still hope for a "green" recovery from the pandemic.
