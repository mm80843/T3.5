## Short summary of the article

Wearable technology, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, has become increasingly popular and affordable, with one in four Americans owning some form of wearable device. These devices have the capability to continuously monitor vital signs and detect changes in the body in real-time. Recent studies have explored the use of wearables in predicting the onset of COVID-19 and monitoring the effects of vaccination and disease progression. Changes in heart rate variability captured by a smartwatch have been found to signal the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection ahead of diagnosis. Additionally, wearables have shown potential in detecting early signs of infection by monitoring metrics related to heart rate. Combining data from wearables with self-reported symptoms could enhance predictive models for detecting infections or other disease states. However, the use of wearables raises ethical concerns around privacy and data protection as large amounts of personal data are collected and shared. Researchers suggest decentralized data ownership and increased regulation to protect individuals' sensitive information. There is also a need to ensure equitable access to wearable technology across socioeconomic groups. The field of wearables is anticipated to continue expanding rapidly, potentially revolutionizing healthcare delivery by enabling remote monitoring and early detection of diseases.

## Summary of the article

Wearable technology, like smartwatches and fitness trackers, can tell you how many steps you've taken, how many calories you've burned, and how well you've slept. They can also track your heart rate and remind you to move around if you've been sitting too long. Some of these devices can even monitor other things like your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Researchers have found that these wearables can be helpful in predicting when someone might get sick, like with COVID-19, by looking at changes in things like heart rate. They can also help people with long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19 by giving them information on when to rest and when to be active. However, there are also concerns about privacy and who has access to the data collected by these devices.
