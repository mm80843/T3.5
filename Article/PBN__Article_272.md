## Short summary of the article

This research paper proposes a health-centric approach to designing and constructing the built environment in order to mitigate the risk of vector-borne diseases, specifically focusing on malaria. The paper highlights the importance of addressing the impact of built environment-related factors on disease transmission through all phases of a building's life cycle. The authors emphasize the need for collaboration between health and built environment professionals to design buildings that provide health-enabling conditions, including access to clean air and water, safe transport, and protection from disease-carrying vectors. The research identifies key factors that contribute to the spread of malaria, such as climate change, population growth, and rapid urbanization. The paper argues for the integration of malaria mitigation strategies into the design process, particularly during the conceptual design phase, to ensure cost-effective and efficient interventions. The authors also emphasize the need for a decision support system and knowledge management framework to facilitate collaboration and share information among stakeholders. Further research will focus on developing a prototype decision support system and exploring cultural nuances in implementing malaria-proof building strategies.

## Summary of the article

Researchers have been studying how to prevent the spread of diseases that are carried by mosquitoes, like malaria. Malaria is a disease that can make people very sick and even cause death. In some countries, a lot of people get malaria every year. The researchers found that the way buildings are designed and constructed can help reduce the risk of getting malaria. For example, sealing off areas where mosquitoes can enter buildings can help keep them out. They also found that building materials can make a difference, as some materials attract mosquitoes more than others. The researchers suggest that building professionals should consider these factors when designing and constructing buildings to help prevent the spread of malaria.
