## Short summary of the article

This research paper investigates the impact of past major pandemics on robot adoption and the distributional consequences of robotization following pandemics. The results suggest that robot adoption increases after pandemic events, particularly when the health impact is severe. Furthermore, the increase in inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, over the medium term is larger in economies with higher robot density and where new robot adoption has increased more after a pandemic. This implies that the distributional effects of COVID-19 could be significant due to an acceleration in robotization. The paper also highlights the relationship between automation and inequality, as low-skilled workers are more at risk of job displacement by robots, leading to income inequality. The study emphasizes the need for policymakers to address the adverse distributional effects of pandemics and robotization, particularly in protecting the most vulnerable workers and implementing policies to ensure a fair transition to an automated workforce.

## Summary of the article

The paper talks about how the COVID-19 pandemic could make robots replace more jobs. Robots are machines that can do tasks automatically. When robots replace jobs, it can make inequality worse because low-skilled workers are more likely to lose their jobs. The paper looked at past pandemics and found that after a pandemic, more robots were used in different industries. This could happen with COVID-19 too, which means more jobs could be replaced by robots. This could make inequality even higher in the future. Policymakers need to think about how to help people who may lose their jobs to robots and how to make sure everyone has a fair chance in the future.
