## Short summary of the article

This research article discusses the risks and challenges associated with the transmission of airborne pathogens in indoor environments and presents various methods and technologies for removing pathogens from indoor air. The article highlights the importance of knowledge in different fields, such as the type of pathogen, its generation and survival mechanisms, and transmission mechanisms among people, in order to successfully address this problem. The article discusses the generation and airborne transmission of pathogens, considering factors such as the respiratory tract sites where pathogens multiply and are dispersed, as well as the size distribution of respiratory aerosols. It explores different methods for removing pathogens from indoor air, including dilution, filtration, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), photocatalytic oxidation, desiccant rotor, plasmacluster ions, essential oils, nanotechnology, and personalized ventilation. The effectiveness, limitations, and potential health risks of these methods are discussed. The article also emphasizes the importance of proper air distribution systems in reducing the risk of airborne transmission, with a focus on the benefits of personalized ventilation in protecting occupants from pathogens in indoor environments. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the challenges of airborne pathogen transmission in indoor environments and offers various strategies for improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of infection.

## Summary of the article

People live and work in crowded places where they can be exposed to many germs. This can make them sick and also affect how well they can work or enjoy their time. There have been many diseases in history that have spread quickly and made a lot of people sick, like the Spanish flu in 1918. This is a problem because people can travel easily now, which can help diseases spread even faster. It's important to make sure that the air indoors is clean and doesn't have any germs. Unfortunately, many buildings and air systems are not designed to prevent the spread of germs. There are different methods and technologies that can be used to clean the air, like filters, ultraviolet light, and personalized ventilation. These methods can help keep people healthy and prevent the spread of diseases.
