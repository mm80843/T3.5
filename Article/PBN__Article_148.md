## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in industrial activity and transport emissions, leading to improved air quality and a glimpse of a greener future. Lockdown measures and stay-at-home orders resulted in a decline in road traffic, air travel, and public transport ridership. People noticed cleaner air, reduced noise pollution, and the benefits of walking and cycling. This shift to a slower, more local, and less-carbon intensive existence demonstrated the potential for sustained changes in a post-COVID world. The pandemic also highlighted the role of individual responsibility and actions in achieving positive social and environmental outcomes. As discussions of the "new normal" and post-COVID recovery take place, there are opportunities to develop a new future for transport. This paper proposes the concept of Responsible Transport, which emphasizes the role of individual choices and actions in delivering socially desired outcomes. It encourages individuals to consider the impact of their travel choices on themselves, others, and the environment, and advocates for a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation. It also highlights the importance of empowering individuals to effect positive change and calls for a reconfiguration of transport policies and practices at all levels, from local to international.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big decrease in people traveling and going to work because of the lockdowns. This led to cleaner air and less traffic in cities. Many people started walking and cycling more since there were less cars on the road. After the pandemic, we have a chance to think about how we travel and make choices that are better for the environment. This is called Responsible Transport, and it means thinking about the impact our travel choices have on the planet and choosing options that are safer and cleaner. We can also ask our employers to support sustainable travel options like working from home or using public transportation. This way, we can take responsibility for our actions and help make the world a better place.
