## Short summary of the article

This study investigates the role of travel restrictions and transmission control measures in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in China during the first 50 days from December 31, 2019, to February 19, 2020. The analysis includes data on COVID-19 cases, human movement, and public health interventions. The study finds that the travel ban implemented in Wuhan resulted in a decrease in the number of exportations of COVID-19 from the city. Furthermore, the delay in the arrival of COVID-19 in other cities due to the travel ban provided extra time for preparation. The study also reveals that the implementation of control measures, such as suspending intracity public transport and closing entertainment venues, were associated with a reduction in cases during the first week of outbreaks. However, the prohibition of travel between cities did not reduce the number of cases in other cities. The study suggests that the combined effect of the travel ban and other control measures contributed to a significant reduction in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China.

## Summary of the article

In December 2019, a new type of virus called coronavirus started spreading in Wuhan city, China. This virus can make people sick and is easily spread from person to person. Because of this, the Chinese government took measures to control the virus, like closing schools and entertainment venues, banning public gatherings, and stopping people from traveling in and out of certain cities. They also closed off Wuhan city completely, which had a lot of people. These measures helped slow down the spread of the virus and reduce the number of cases. Other countries can learn from these actions to help control the virus in their own countries.
