## Short summary of the article

This research abstract explores the potential application of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The IoT provides real-time data collection for monitoring the pandemic, while big data enables modeling studies and assessment of preparedness in different regions. Digital technology also enhances public health education and communication through platforms like WhatsApp and social media. AI algorithms can be used for screening and triaging patients, as well as discovering new drugs. In terms of mitigating the impact of COVID-19, virtual clinics through telemedicine consultations and AI-based triage systems can help maintain clinical services. Blockchain technology can facilitate the timely delivery of medications. This summary highlights the potential for digital technologies to support traditional public health measures and improve the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Summary of the article

In 2020, there were supposed to be exciting advancements in medicine and science using digital technologies like the internet of things, big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. These technologies could help us understand diseases, predict outcomes, and keep our healthcare systems running smoothly. But then the COVID-19 pandemic happened, and we had to find new ways to fight it. Traditional methods like quarantine and contact tracing are not enough this time. So, we can use these digital technologies to monitor and track the spread of the virus, analyze data to make better decisions, educate people about the virus, and even develop new treatments. It's like using new tools to help us in a new challenge.
