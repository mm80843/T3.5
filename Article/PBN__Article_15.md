## Short summary of the article

This research abstract examines the combined adoption of the concepts of smart cities and safe cities in urban areas. It highlights the challenges faced in implementing these concepts, such as privacy concerns, control issues, and propaganda. The abstract discusses the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Blockchain in the management of smart cities and safe cities. It also emphasizes the need for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in financing these projects, but acknowledges the reservations of citizens regarding the involvement of private entities in data collection and management. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing privacy, security, and control concerns in order to achieve urban comfort and acceptance of these concepts.

## Summary of the article

The world is becoming more urbanized, which means there are more people living in cities. But this also brings with it new challenges, like conflicts and inequality. To help make cities safer and more secure, there are two concepts that are gaining popularity: the safe city and the smart city.

A safe city is a place where people, businesses, and properties are protected from both external and internal threats. This is done by using technologies like cameras, sensors, and data analysis to monitor and respond to potential dangers. The goal is to prevent crime and violence and make cities a better place to live.

A smart city, on the other hand, is a place where different parts of the city, like buildings, transportation, and utilities, are connected through technology. This allows for better management and control of these systems, making the city more efficient and livable.

But there are some concerns about these concepts. One big concern is privacy. The data that is collected by these technologies can be personal and sensitive, and people worry about how it will be used and who will have access to it. There are also concerns about control, as some people worry that these technologies give too much power to governments or private companies.

Despite these concerns, many cities around the world are adopting these concepts because they believe it will make their cities safer and better places to live. But it's important to address the concerns about privacy and control to ensure that these concepts are used in a way that benefits everyone.
