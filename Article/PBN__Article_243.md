## Short summary of the article

This scoping review summarizes the main interventions implemented by governments in response to the psychosocial and economic outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review includes studies published between December 2019 and December 2020 and focuses on economic, social, and psychological interventions. The findings reveal that governments have taken various measures to manage the negative effects of the pandemic on different populations. Economic interventions primarily target impoverished households and include cash payments, loan guarantees, tax deferrals, subsidies, and employment protections. Social support measures aim to protect vulnerable groups and include providing shelters, personal protective equipment, and support for victims of domestic violence, refugees, and the elderly. Psychological interventions have been delivered remotely through virtual platforms and telemedicine, with a focus on resilience, flexibility, and emotional regulation. However, there are disparities in the implementation of interventions, with high-income countries having more resources to address these issues compared to lower-income countries. In conclusion, governments have a responsibility to support vulnerable populations and mitigate the socioeconomic and psychological impacts of the pandemic.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of problems for people all around the world. It has made people sick and caused many deaths. Not only does it affect people's physical health, but it also has a big impact on their mental health and the economy. People are feeling anxious and depressed because of the pandemic, and the situation has made it harder for people with existing mental health problems. The pandemic has also caused a lot of problems for businesses and led to a lot of job losses. Governments have tried to help by giving money to people who lost their jobs and providing support for businesses. They have also tried to help people who are at higher risk, like those who are poor or belong to certain ethnicities. Overall, the pandemic has caused a lot of problems, but governments are trying to help people as much as they can.
