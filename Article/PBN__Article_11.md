## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to surgical education, with restrictions on in-person activities and rotations, as well as the discontinuation of elective surgeries. This has led to a decrease in resident case volume and a need for innovative solutions to maintain high-quality surgical education. One approach is the implementation of a flipped classroom strategy, where learners watch prerecorded video lectures before engaging in synthesis, application, and case-based discussions during conference sessions. This approach has shown improved knowledge acquisition and is preferred by trainees. Another innovative solution is the use of a social-media-based platform, such as a closed Facebook group, to provide daily practice questions and discussions. This platform has been found to be helpful and well-utilized by participants. Teleconference formats using online software, such as GoToMeeting, have also been implemented for academic conferences to maintain engagement and interaction among faculty and residents. Telehealth clinics have been introduced, involving trainees in initial contact, history gathering, and plan formulation, with the attending surgeon conducting the final consultation through multi-user video conferences. The use of simulation and high-quality surgical videos has also been recommended to supplement the decrease in operating room time. It is important for surgical organizations to provide alternative approaches, free access to video libraries, and encourage collaboration between institutions to ensure all trainees have access to high-quality education. Future studies should explore the effectiveness of these methods and generate hypotheses for further innovations in surgical education. Overall, these unprecedented circumstances require flexibility, innovation, and cooperation to maintain rigorous standards of education and training for surgical residents.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for surgical trainees to learn in person. This means they have less exposure to surgeries and educational activities. To solve this problem, some institutions have started using technology. They use videos that trainees can watch before a conference, so the conference can focus on discussing cases. They also created a closed Facebook group for trainees to practice surgery questions and discuss topics. Some institutions are now using teleconferences for academic conferences, where trainees and professors can see each other through video. They also use online video conferences for clinic visits, so trainees can still learn from patients. Simulation labs and surgical videos are also being used to help trainees learn. It's important for surgical organizations to work together to find new ways to teach surgical trainees during this difficult time.
