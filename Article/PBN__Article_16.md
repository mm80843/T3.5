## Short summary of the article

This study investigates the feasibility of using cold-spray technique to deposit copper coatings on stainless steel push plates as a means to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The cold-spray process allows for quick and cost-effective coating of existing steel parts with copper. The copper coatings were found to be dense and had a thickness of about 0.7 mm. After polishing, the effective coating thickness was reduced to about 0.45 mm. The surface roughness of the coated plates was higher than that of the original stainless steel push plates. The viricidal activity of the copper-coated push plates was tested against SARS-CoV-2 virus, and it was observed that the copper coatings had a substantial reduction in the titration values, indicating the inactivation capability of the virus. After 2 hours of exposure, 96% of the virus was inactivated on the as-deposited copper coating, and after 5 hours of exposure, 99.2% and 97.9% of the virus were inactivated on the as-deposited and annealed copper coatings, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of using cold-spray copper coatings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and other viruses on high-contact surfaces.

## Summary of the article

Researchers have found that coating stainless steel surfaces with copper can help inactivate the COVID-19 virus. They used a technique called cold-spray to quickly apply a thin layer of copper onto stainless steel push plates. These push plates are often found on doors in public buildings and hospitals, where people touch them to open doors. The copper coating was able to reduce the amount of COVID-19 virus on the surface by 96% to 99.2% after exposure for several hours. This method provides a fast and cost-effective way to make existing surfaces safer and help stop the spread of the virus.
