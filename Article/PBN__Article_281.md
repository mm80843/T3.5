## Short summary of the article

This paper provides an overview of the challenges and health impacts associated with indoor air pollution (IAP), particularly in developing countries. It discusses the use of biomass fuels for cooking and heating purposes, which is a major contributor to IAP and associated health issues. The paper highlights the need for improved ventilation and cleaner cooking solutions to reduce IAP and improve indoor air quality (IAQ). Several IAQ monitoring systems are reviewed, including those based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of these systems are discussed, along with the potential for future research in IAQ monitoring. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of developing cost-effective and accurate IAQ monitoring systems to address the health challenges posed by IAP.

## Summary of the article

Researchers have been studying the quality of the air we breathe, especially indoors. They have found that the air we breathe indoors can be even more dangerous than the air outside. In many developing countries, people use biomass fuels like wood and coal for cooking indoors, and this leads to indoor air pollution. This pollution can cause a lot of health problems like respiratory infections, asthma, and even cancer. In developed countries, people use cleaner fuels like electricity, but there are still problems with indoor air quality due to modern heating and cooling systems. To help solve this problem, researchers are developing systems to monitor indoor air quality and alert people to any dangers. These systems can help improve the air we breathe and keep us healthier.
