# __Risk Diagnosis and Mitigation System of COVID-19 Using Expert System and Web Scraping__

## DOI of the article

10.1109/IES50839.2020.9231619

## Short summary of the article

This research paper proposes the development of a mobile application that uses an expert system and web scraping to provide early detection and information on COVID-19 in Indonesia. The expert system is based on a rule-based method and is designed to help users assess their risk of contracting COVID-19 based on a set of symptoms. The application also includes a web scraping component that retrieves COVID-19 mitigation information and case developments from official websites. The system design includes a knowledge base for symptom-based diagnosis and a SQLite database for storing scraped data. The performance evaluation of the application indicates that it is user-friendly and performs well in terms of satisfaction and ease of use. The expert system's results were validated through various test scenarios. The study concludes that the application can provide early detection and mitigation information for COVID-19 in Indonesia, with potential future enhancements such as patient tracking features.

## Summary of the article

This text is about a mobile application that helps people detect early symptoms of COVID-19 using an expert system. An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence that can solve problems like a human expert. The app also uses web scraping to get information about COVID-19 cases and mitigation strategies in Indonesia. The system design of the app includes the expert system for early detection and the web scraping process for retrieving data from official websites. The app has been tested and found to be user-friendly and accurate in detecting COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this research is to provide a useful tool for people to detect COVID-19 early and to provide information on COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.
