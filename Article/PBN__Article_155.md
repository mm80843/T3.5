## Short summary of the article

This research study conducted in a hospital setting confirmed that portable air filters effectively remove SARS-CoV-2 particles from the air, providing the first evidence of their effectiveness in a real-world situation. The study suggests that air filters could be used in hospitals to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among patients and medical staff. In the general ward, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the air was observed when the filter was turned off but not when it was on. However, the researchers surprisingly found low levels of viral particles in the air of the ICU ward, even when the filter there was switched off, possibly due to slower viral replication at later stages of the disease. The study highlights the importance of implementing measures to remove the virus from the air in general wards. The use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters was found to be an inexpensive and easy way to reduce the risk of airborne pathogen transmission in hospitals. The filters also effectively removed other hospital-related pathogens from the air. This study suggests that infections caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pyogenes may also be spread through aerosol transmission. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the effectiveness of air filters in real-world settings to ensure they provide actual protection against SARS-CoV-2 transmission rather than a false sense of security.

## Summary of the article

A study at a hospital found that air filters can help remove the virus that causes COVID-19 from the air. The researchers used portable air filters in two wards, and they found that when the filters were on, they didn't find many virus particles in the air. This means that using air filters in hospitals could help protect patients and medical staff from getting sick. The filters also removed other germs that can cause infections in hospitals. This study shows that air filters can be a simple and cheap way to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in hospitals.
