## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of occupant presence, air exchange rate, class duration, and working hours on HVAC energy consumption and the number of people infected with COVID-19 in a university building. The goal was to find the optimal occupant distribution pattern that minimizes both energy consumption and the number of infected people. The study used the NSGA-II algorithm for optimization and EnergyPlus for energy simulations. The results showed that optimizing the occupant distribution pattern can significantly reduce both energy consumption and the number of infected people. It was observed that a uniform population distribution pattern can reduce the number of infected people by up to 56%, while an optimal population distribution pattern aligned with climatic conditions can reduce energy consumption by up to 32%. The study also found that increasing the air exchange rate and reducing class duration and working hours can further reduce the number of infected people, but it increases energy consumption. The findings highlight the importance of considering occupant behavior and building parameters in energy management and infection control strategies in buildings.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how different factors in a building, such as the number of people, air flow, and working hours, can affect both the energy consumption of the building's HVAC system and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The researchers used an optimization algorithm to find the best occupancy schedule that minimizes energy consumption and the number of infected people. They found that optimizing the occupancy schedule can significantly reduce energy consumption and the number of infected people. Increasing the air exchange rate and reducing the duration of classes also helped to lower the risk of virus transmission. Overall, these findings suggest that changing the way people are distributed in a building can help save energy and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
