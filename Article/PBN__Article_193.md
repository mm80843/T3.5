## Short summary of the article

This research study examines office workplace modifications implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. The study includes a literature review of public and industrial guidelines, workplace safety and health control, and corporate real estate management (CREM) theory. The findings show that organizations have undertaken various workplace modifications in response to the pandemic, primarily focusing on social distancing and personal protection measures. Administrative controls and personal protective equipment have been the dominant approaches used in workplace management. The study also highlights the importance of strategic alignment between corporate business strategies and office workplace modifications. The findings suggest that organizations have been proactive in adapting to the community measures and have implemented changes at both operational and strategic levels. The study concludes that workplace management practices have varied among different sectors, and long-term workplace redesign and virtual office spaces may become trends in the future.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses had to stop working to prevent the spread of the virus. This led to a decrease in productivity and affected how people work together. To adapt to the pandemic, organizations have either expanded their workplace in the virtual dimension or made changes to their physical workplace. They have modified their offices to follow COVID-19 measures and suit the new normal. Some organizations have entered the "re-entry" stage, where they have developed a plan to continue working during the pandemic. However, the "re-imagination" stage, which involves making changes for the future, is still uncertain. Many organizations are making modifications to their workplace to keep employees safe and productive.
