## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had massive impacts on cities around the world. Cities in China went into lockdown, cutting off access to essential supplies and overwhelming medical facilities. Cities in other countries have also been affected, with major economic, educational, and travel disruptions. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of urban planning and architecture in responding to and mitigating the effects of pandemics. However, the role of these professions has often been overlooked. Cities need to be prepared for emergencies by constructing specialized medical facilities and implementing better data management systems. International architectural and urban institutions should be involved in disaster response planning, including biological disasters like pandemics. Standardization of protocols and access to data is crucial for effective response and monitoring. The focus should be on promoting resilient and sustainable communities that can withstand pandemics and other disasters. It is important to start these discussions now to prepare for future outbreaks.

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and has caused a lot of problems for cities. Some cities in China were locked down, which means people couldn't go to work or leave their homes. This caused a shortage of food, water, and medical supplies. The virus is also affecting the economy and making it hard for people to travel. It's important for architects and urban planners to think about how to make cities better prepared for pandemics in the future. They can help by building emergency hospitals and creating plans to keep people safe.
