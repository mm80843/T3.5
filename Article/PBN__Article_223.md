## Short summary of the article

This research study analyzes the costs and benefits of improving the efficiency of office space and the quality of indoor climate. The study focuses on a case building located in Finland and explores different space arrangements and indoor climate improvements. The results show that improving the efficiency of space can significantly increase the number of workstations, with the open-plan office arrangement being the most efficient. However, it is important to ensure that the quality of indoor climate is maintained as increased efficiency can lead to higher levels of contamination and heat loads. The study highlights the economic benefits of improving indoor climate, including reduced refurbishment costs, operation and maintenance costs, and improved productivity. The findings also indicate that the cost-effectiveness of improving indoor climate depends on the nature of work and the value of labor. Overall, the study concludes that proper planning and design can improve the efficiency of office space while maintaining a high-quality indoor climate.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how office spaces can be used more efficiently. They found that by making changes to the layout of the office, they were able to fit more workstations in the same amount of space. However, they also found that when the space is used more efficiently, it can lead to problems with the air quality and temperature in the office. This can affect the health and productivity of the people working there. The study showed that it is worth investing in making the indoor climate better, as it can increase productivity and save money in the long run.
