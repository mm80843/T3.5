## Short summary of the article

This research paper discusses the potential risks and benefits of green and blue infrastructure in urban environments. The authors highlight that incorporating green elements into urban areas can have multiple societal benefits such as promoting physical activity, improving air quality, and reducing exposure to waterborne pathogens. Numerous studies have shown a positive effect of green spaces on health, including increased life expectancy, better self-reported health, and lower blood pressure. However, the authors also note that there can be unintended negative effects such as increased air pollution and the potential for attracting pests and disease vectors. The authors emphasize the need for well-planned design features to mitigate these risks and suggest that public health perspectives should be integrated into urban planning from the early stages to prevent later unintended health problems. The paper also discusses specific examples of potential risks, such as increased tick populations in urban green spaces and the allergenic effects of urban trees. The authors suggest methods for preventing or managing these problems, including proper rodent management, control of algal blooms, and careful selection of tree species to minimize allergenic potential. In conclusion, the authors argue that while green and blue infrastructure offers many benefits, it is important to be aware of and address the potential health risks associated with these interventions.

## Summary of the article

Many countries and communities are using green and blue infrastructure to help with weather and climate issues. Green infrastructure involves adding vegetation to concrete environments, which can have many benefits like promoting physical activity and improving air quality. Studies have even shown that people who live close to green areas are healthier. However, there are also potential risks with green and blue infrastructure, like increased exposure to pests and diseases. Proper planning and design can help to minimize these risks and create a safe and healthy environment for everyone.
