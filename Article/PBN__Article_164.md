## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a commentary on the use of big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and smart city technology in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The commentary focuses on the application of these technologies in the Newcastle Urban Observatory (UO), which monitors various aspects of urban landscapes in real-time. The UO was able to track the effectiveness of government policy interventions and social changes during the pandemic using data visualizations and a COVID-19 dashboard. The observatory collects a large amount of data from IoT sensors and uses machine learning to analyze and visualize the data. The ongoing monitoring provided policymakers with insight into changing social behavior and the impact of lockdown measures. The research highlights the importance of capturing observations from the wider region, not just city centers, to understand mobility patterns. Additionally, the UO has seen improvements in environmental indices such as air pollution during the lockdown. The commentary emphasizes the need for a collaborative relationship between research institutions and public authorities to effectively use data for urban governance and management. The integration of quantitative data analysis and understanding human behavior is crucial for a deeper understanding of urban science developments.

## Summary of the article

A city called Newcastle in England has a program called the Newcastle Urban Observatory that collects lots of data about the city. This data includes things like traffic, air quality, weather, and more. They use sensors placed around the city to collect this data. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they used this data to create a special dashboard to track how the virus was affecting the city. They could see things like how many people were on the streets and how traffic changed. This helped the city make decisions about how to respond to the virus. They also found that air pollution improved when fewer cars were on the road. The data they collected can help cities understand how to make improvements in the future.
