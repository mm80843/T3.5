## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes an article that explores the role of architecture and urban design in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article asks important questions about the future of urban dynamics, the socio-spatial implications of social distancing measures, and the spatial requirements of post-pandemic living and working patterns. It highlights the impact of disease on cities throughout history and suggests that COVID-19 may lead to significant changes in urban design and planning. The abstract also discusses the importance of transdisciplinary thinking to address these complex challenges and emphasizes the need for a focus on health in the built environment. The abstract concludes by highlighting the significance of the "new normal" and the shift towards a virtual world in the post-pandemic era. Overall, the article provides valuable insights into the potential contributions of architecture and urban design in developing healthy and sustainable environments in the face of a global pandemic.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of sickness and death around the world. To try and stop the spread of the virus, people have been practicing social distancing, which means staying away from others and not touching them. This has affected how cities are designed and how people live and work. Architects and urban planners are thinking about how to make healthy environments that can still accommodate people while keeping them safe from the virus. They are also thinking about how cities might change in the future because of the pandemic. This includes looking at factors like population density, transportation, and the use of public spaces. The goal is to create spaces that support health and well-being and help people live and work in a safe and comfortable way.
