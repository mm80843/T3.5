## Short summary of the article

COVID-19 is known to be associated with social inequalities, including differential exposure to the virus, greater susceptibility to infection, and disparate access to care. In a study published in The Lancet Public Health, Vandentorren and colleagues investigated the association between area-based deprivation and SARS-CoV-2 incidence, positivity, and testing rates in France. The study found that individuals living in the most deprived areas had the highest risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 but were less likely to be tested. This social gradient was more pronounced in densely populated areas. The study also analyzed the impact of government measures, such as lockdowns, on these outcomes and found differential effects based on deprivation and population density. The study had some limitations, including exclusion of certain area codes and the lack of individual-level socioeconomic data. The findings highlight the complex interaction between COVID-19 and social inequalities, with socioeconomic disparities exacerbating the negative impact of the pandemic. Further research is needed to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics involved and incorporate vaccination uptake into the analyses.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 virus affects people differently based on their social status. This means that people who are poorer or live in more crowded areas are more likely to catch the virus and less likely to get tested for it. A study in France found that in areas with more poverty, there were more cases of COVID-19 but fewer tests being done. This shows that some people are not getting the help they need to stay safe from the virus. The study looked at how the virus spread during different lockdowns and found that the impact was different depending on how rich or poor the area was. This means that COVID-19 is making social inequalities worse, because people who are already at a disadvantage are getting even less help during the pandemic.
