# __Ten questions concerning occupant health in buildings during normal operations and extreme events including the COVID-19 pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107480

## Short summary of the article

This research paper explores the topic of occupant health in buildings, focusing on the physical, mental, and social well-being of individuals. The authors discuss the concept of "healthy buildings," which are built structures that promote the positive well-being of occupants. Despite the importance of healthy buildings, there is currently no clear and commonly accepted definition of what constitutes a healthy building. The paper also examines how buildings can impact occupant health in terms of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) factors such as air quality, thermal comfort, lighting, acoustics, and water quality. The economic impacts of unhealthy buildings are discussed, including increased health care costs, reduced productivity, and increased sick leave. The authors also highlight the importance of considering occupant health in building design and operations, especially in the face of extreme events such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging technologies, such as sensors and artificial intelligence, are explored as potential tools for achieving healthy buildings. The paper concludes by identifying future research directions, including the need for common standards and guidelines for evaluating healthy buildings and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in this field.

## Summary of the article

Buildings can have a big impact on our health. They can affect our physical, mental, and social well-being. For example, the air quality inside a building can make us sick if there are pollutants like dust or chemicals. Poor lighting or noisy environments can also affect our mood and concentration. Buildings that are designed with our health in mind can promote better well-being. However, there are still many challenges in understanding and creating healthy buildings. We need to do more research to figure out the best ways to design and maintain buildings that support our health.
