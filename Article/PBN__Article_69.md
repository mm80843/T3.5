## Short summary of the article

This study proposes a mathematical framework that incorporates urban design into epidemiological models to understand the impact of city characteristics on the spread of infectious diseases. The framework uses spatially-resolved census data to infer transportation patterns in cities and introduces the concept of agglomeration of urban mobility. The study focuses on the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (GDL) as an example and demonstrates that changes in the spatial distribution of housing, education, and economic activities can significantly affect the size and early growth rate of epidemics. The results show that the spatial organization of human mobility plays a crucial role in epidemic growth and can lead to health inequalities at the neighborhood level. The study also suggests that urban design can be optimized to modify epidemic growth rates and reduce the probability of large outbreaks. The framework provides a feasible alternative to agent-based models in large-scale epidemiological simulations by using standard census and economic data. However, further refinements and additions to the framework are needed to capture the complexity of real-world interactions and dynamics. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the impact of urban design on disease spread to inform public health interventions and policies in cities.

## Summary of the article

This article is about how the design of cities can affect the spread of diseases like the flu. The researchers used math to study how people move around in a city and how that can affect the spread of a disease. They found that if all the activities and jobs are concentrated in one part of the city, it can make the disease spread faster. But if the activities and jobs are spread out more evenly, it can help slow down the spread of the disease. They also found that where a person lives in the city can affect how likely they are to get sick and spread the disease. Overall, this research can help us understand how to design cities in a way that can prevent the spread of diseases.
