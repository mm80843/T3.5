## Short summary of the article

This study evaluated the effectiveness of upper-room ultraviolet (UV) lights and negative air ionization in preventing airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission. The study used a guinea pig air-sampling model to measure TB infectiousness in a ward in Lima, Peru. The results showed that both the UV lights and the ionizers significantly reduced TB infection and disease in the guinea pigs compared to the control group. The UV lights reduced TB infection from 35% in the control group to 9.5% in the UV group, and ionizers reduced TB infection to 14%. Both interventions also prevented TB disease, with the UV lights reducing disease from 8.6% in the control group to 3.6% in the UV group, and ionizers reducing disease to 4.3%. An alternative analysis using an airborne infection model showed that the UV lights and ionizers prevented 70% and 60% of TB infection, respectively, and 54% and 51% of TB disease, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrate that both upper-room UV lights and negative air ionization are effective in preventing airborne TB transmission, making them potential infection control measures in high-risk clinical settings.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how to stop the spread of TB in hospitals. They used a special light called ultraviolet (UV) light and a machine called an ionizer to see if they could stop the TB germs from spreading in the air. They tested these methods using guinea pigs in cages. They found that using the UV light or the ionizer made it harder for the guinea pigs to get infected with TB. This means that if hospitals use these methods, it could help stop the spread of TB in the air.
