## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in various nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by countries worldwide. While these interventions have been effective in controlling the spread of the virus, they can also have negative effects on healthcare access, mental health, domestic violence rates, and the economy. However, there are also positive health effects associated with the pandemic response, such as reduced pollution, fewer road accidents, and lower incidence of respiratory infections.

Two studies conducted in Germany investigated the effects of NPIs on the incidence of other diseases in 2020. The first study showed a significant decline in respiratory diseases like influenza and measles during the implementation of NPIs, with the exception of rhinoviruses, which rebounded after the reopening of schools. The second study confirmed a reduction in respiratory and a wide range of other infectious diseases during the same time period compared to previous years.

Both studies concluded that NPIs significantly reduce the overall incidence of infectious diseases, suggesting that these interventions may have long-term non-COVID-19 control benefits. They emphasize the importance of considering both the harmful collateral effects and the indirect positive effects of NPIs on health. While there is a push to return to normalcy, the studies highlight the immediate health and well-being benefits of elements from the NPI portfolio, such as face masks, physical distancing, and improved hand hygiene, even outside of pandemic periods. These benefits should be taken into account when considering the discontinuation of NPIs.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries like Germany used strategies called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to try and stop the spread of the virus. Some of these strategies were things like wearing masks and staying apart from other people. While these strategies helped with the pandemic, they also had some negative effects. It became harder for people to get the medical care they needed, and some diseases like heart disease decreased while others like HIV/AIDS and malaria may increase. NPIs also made some people feel sad or stressed, and they had negative effects on the economy. However, there were some positive effects too. Pollution went down, there were fewer car accidents, and less people got sick with respiratory infections. Two studies done in Germany showed that NPIs helped to reduce the spread of other diseases too. So even though NPIs can be hard, they can also help keep us healthy.
