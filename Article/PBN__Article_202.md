# __How COVID-19 Redefines the Concept of Sustainability__

## DOI of the article

10.3390/su12093727

## Short summary of the article

This article proposes redefining sustainability to include human health as a fourth pillar, in addition to economic development, social development, and environmental protection. The importance of human health in sustainability is highlighted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current definition of sustainability, which only includes economic, social, and environmental aspects, does not adequately address the significance of health. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a goal for good health, but it is important to distinguish between the SDGs and the overall definition of sustainability. While society is often seen as including human health, the term has come to focus mainly on social wellbeing. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on physical and mental health, affecting not only the general population but also healthcare workers. The pandemic has also had far-reaching consequences for the economy, social issues like domestic violence, and conservation efforts. The proposed fourth pillar of sustainability would recognize the importance of human health in the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental systems.

## Summary of the article

Sustainability means taking care of the earth, making sure people are treated fairly, and making sure everyone has enough food and water. It also means keeping our environment clean and healthy. The United Nations made 17 goals to help make the world a better place. One of these goals is good health, which means making sure everyone is healthy and safe. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how important our health is to keeping everything going smoothly. The authors of this article think that we should add human health as a fourth pillar of sustainability, so that we remember how important it is to take care of ourselves and others.
