## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the vulnerabilities and lack of preparedness of human societies in the face of global disasters. The outbreak has emphasized the link between human health and the state of the environment, highlighting the risks of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. The pandemic has exacerbated social inequalities, impacting low-income individuals, marginalized communities, and women the most. It has also exposed the risks associated with hyper-connected economic and financial systems, which lack resilience to unexpected events. While the pandemic has resulted in temporary improvements in air quality and reduced pollution, its impact on climate change and biodiversity conservation remains uncertain. The economic recession due to COVID-19 may hinder sustainability efforts, as policymakers prioritize economic revitalization over conservation and sustainability. To transition towards a sustainable future, recovery funds should be directed toward innovative technologies and sustainable energy development. The implementation of sustainable policies requires a shift in societal priorities, from gross domestic product (GDP) to human well-being and a healthy environment. This transition must prioritize environmental justice, including distributive justice, procedural justice, and restorative justice. It also requires a shift in social representations and a reconnection with nature. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis presents an opportunity to move towards a greener, more sustainable, and equitable society, but it requires cooperation, collaboration, and a change in worldviews.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of problems for people all over the world. It has made a lot of people sick and caused many deaths. It has also made the economy go down and made many people lose their jobs. The pandemic has shown us that we need to take better care of the environment and be more prepared for disasters. We also need to make sure that everyone has equal access to health care and other important services. The pandemic has also shown us that our economy is too connected and fragile, and we need to make changes to make it more stable. We need to focus on sustainable solutions that help the environment and make life better for everyone.
