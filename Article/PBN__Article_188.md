## Short summary of the article

This article examines the risk communication during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. It highlights the importance of effective risk communication in public health emergencies and the challenges faced in the early management of the outbreak. The study uses a message-centered approach to analyze the government's decision-making, information dissemination, and risk interpretation. It discusses the principles for effective risk communication, including the accessibility and openness of risk information, early and regular communication, strategic methods for communicating uncertainty, and acknowledging diverse levels of risk tolerance. The study identifies the need for collaboration between the government, experts, and the public in risk communication. The article concludes by presenting a simplified model of government-expert-public risk communication to guide effective communication strategies in future outbreaks.

## Summary of the article

In December 2019, a new virus called COVID-19 started spreading in a city called Wuhan in China. This virus is called a coronavirus and it can make people sick. There were some problems with how the government in Wuhan communicated about the risk of the virus. They didn't make good decisions at first and they didn't give all the information to the public. This made it harder for people to know how to stay safe. It's important for the government to be honest and tell people the truth about the virus. They should also listen to experts and make decisions based on what they say. Good communication can help stop the virus from spreading.
