## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on digital health technologies and data sharing in medical research. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) and other real-world data sources have been instrumental in generating evidence for COVID-19 research. However, challenges in data capture and sharing, including non-standardized data collection, data terminology heterogeneity, and barriers to data sharing have led to data gaps and limited the research potential of these datasets. Efforts have been made to mine valuable insights from these data sources, and international collaborations have been established to leverage real-world evidence in COVID-19 research. The need for comprehensive checklists and guidelines to critically appraise research using real-world data is emphasized. Data sharing for COVID-19 research has faced challenges, including concerns over privacy, data governance, and technical issues. While there have been initiatives to improve data sharing, the pace of sharing has been inadequate, particularly in the context of clinical trial data. The importance of reproducibility in digital health research and the need for timely data transfer are also highlighted. There is a need for better incentives and resources to encourage data sharing and improved data sharing frameworks in the research community. The abstract concludes by discussing the potential for sustained progress in data collection and innovation in the post-pandemic era.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have been using digital health technologies to collect and analyze large amounts of data to inform decision making. This includes using electronic health records (EHRs) to monitor patient information and study the effects of treatments and vaccines. However, there have been challenges in sharing and accessing data, such as non-standardized data collection and barriers to data sharing. Despite these challenges, researchers have made progress in using real-world evidence to study COVID-19. Collaborative international efforts, like the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19, have helped gather data from different countries. It's important to improve data sharing and develop guidelines for using real-world evidence to ensure high-quality research.
