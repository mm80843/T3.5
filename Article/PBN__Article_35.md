## Short summary of the article

This study examines the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The IoT is a network of smart devices that exchange data via the internet. IoT has a wide range of applications, including healthcare systems, driverless vehicles, home and industrial automation, intelligent transportation, and smart grids. The Covid-19 pandemic has created a need for IoT to help monitor and control the spread of the virus. IoT can help track high-risk patients, measure vital signs, and reduce the workload for medical staff. Several research studies have explored the use of IoT in managing the pandemic, including IoT-based drug delivery, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for orthopaedic patients, and Industrial IoT technologies. Challenges such as scalability, energy requirements, and data security and privacy need to be addressed when implementing IoT for Covid-19. Despite these challenges, IoT has proven to be a valuable tool in fighting the pandemic, offering early detection, monitoring, and contact tracing solutions. However, future research is needed to ensure accurate and secure data generation by IoT devices. The findings suggest that IoT can greatly contribute to public health efforts in managing the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Summary of the article

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of smart devices that can talk to each other using the Internet. These devices can help us control objects around us and keep us updated on their condition. IoT has many applications, including healthcare, transportation, and home automation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, IoT has been used to track patients, monitor their health, and help healthcare workers. There are also special IoT devices, like tracking bracelets and buttons, that can help with safety and sanitation. However, there are challenges in making sure that the data collected by IoT devices is accurate and secure. Overall, IoT has been a helpful technology during the pandemic.
