## Short summary of the article

This research article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry. The study utilizes a two-fold methodology, including exploratory interviews with construction industry experts and a questionnaire survey of construction practitioners. The data collected is analyzed using descriptive analysis and thematic content analysis. The results indicate that the pandemic has suspended many construction projects, with only essential projects related to medical facilities continuing. The pandemic has also resulted in labor impact and job loss, time overrun, cost overrun, and financial impact in the construction industry. The findings highlight the need for the construction industry to adapt and prepare for similar unforeseen events in the future. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the construction industry for stakeholders and policymakers.

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, started in Wuhan, China and has spread all over the world. It is a very infectious disease that has caused a pandemic, which is when a disease affects many countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on the economy, including the construction industry. Construction workers and engineers usually have to work on-site, but because of the pandemic, many construction projects have been suspended. This has led to job losses and other problems in the construction industry. This article is about a study that looked at the effects of the pandemic on the construction industry and found that it has been greatly impacted. The study surveyed experts in the construction industry and found that projects have been suspended, workers have lost their jobs, and there have been delays and increased costs for construction projects. The findings of the study can help the construction industry come up with plans to deal with future pandemics or similar situations.
