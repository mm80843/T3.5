## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has had a significant global impact, with millions of people affected and economies disrupted. Information Technology (IT) has emerged as a crucial tool in the fight against the virus. The virus, named SARS-CoV-2, primarily affects the respiratory system, causing symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. It is spread through respiratory droplets and can survive on surfaces for extended periods. Currently, there is no standard vaccine or cure for the virus. To prevent infection, individuals are advised to practice proper hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. Additionally, healthcare workers should utilize personal protective equipment. The IT sector has played a vital role in combating the pandemic, with robotics, drones, big data, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, and IoT and AI technologies being employed. These technologies can assist in tasks such as disinfection, delivery of essential goods, monitoring of individuals, and early detection of cases. By harnessing IT solutions, it is possible to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and ultimately find a cure for the disease.

## Summary of the article

COVID-19 is a virus that spreads from person to person and can make people sick. It mostly affects the lungs and can make it hard to breathe. Right now, there is no vaccine or cure for the virus. To help stop the spread, people should wash their hands a lot and avoid touching their face. Information Technology (IT) is a field that uses computers and technology to solve problems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, IT is being used to help diagnose and treat the virus, like using robots to clean hospitals and drones to deliver medicine. IT can play a big role in helping to stop the virus and keep people safe.
