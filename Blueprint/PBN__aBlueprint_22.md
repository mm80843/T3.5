# __Implementing Infectious Disease Control Measures within Sustainable Urban Developments__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Healthcare systems overwhelmed, limited access to services, scarcity of resources, and risk to healthcare workers.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_60.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The 'Blueprint' data addresses the risks associated with the healthcare systems as experienced due to contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. With the focus primarily on the infrastructure and the capacity of healthcare systems and facilities, the blueprint aims at providing a strategic plan to mitigate these risks. The healthcare systems are at risk due to various challenges such as shortages of personnel, equipment, and medication, healthcare disparities, inadequate healthcare response, and disruption of core clinical services. Key stakeholders in the context of this blueprint are the healthcare professionals, policymakers, researchers, and patients who contribute to the formulation of mitigation strategies.

* The risks addressed by the blueprint revolve around the availability, accessibility, and adequacy of healthcare systems and infrastructure. They highlight potential issues such as overloaded healthcare facilities, limited healthcare personnel, and the collapse of health services due to a lack of resources. These risks pose significant challenges to both healthcare providers and patients and can negatively impact the overall health outcomes. The blueprint brings attention to these risks, paving the way for targeted mitigation measures that ensure the resilience of the healthcare systems, especially in the context of contagious diseases and the subsequent strains on infrastructure.

* In terms of mitigation measures, the blueprint primarily focuses on the enhancement and strengthening of healthcare infrastructure. Some of the key steps include increasing hospital capacity, ensuring adequate medical supplies, and establishing temporary medical facilities during outbreaks. The use of technological tools for disease management, such as telemedicine and artificial intelligence, are also identified as key mitigating factors. These strategies are framed with the notion of ensuring better access to healthcare services and improved readiness in the face of potential outbreaks.

* Implementing the blueprint's mitigation measures generates several benefits, the most significant of which is an enhanced healthcare delivery system. The provision of adequate healthcare services becomes more efficient, thus ensuring patients' needs are adequately met. Improved access to healthcare ensures services are equitably distributed, reducing disparities in health. In addition, implementing the blueprint involves leveraging modern technology such as telemedicine and data analytics, which not only enable remote healthcare but also help in real-time monitoring and prediction of disease spread, thereby improving disease management and control over time.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The Blueprint presents a mitigation strategy for managing the risks related to contagions in green building neighbourhoods. The strategic plan focuses on strengthening the healthcare facilitiesâ€™ infrastructure, establishing additional capacity during outbreaks, utilising telemedicine potential, and ensuring sufficient medical supplies. The implementation process involves relevant stakeholders, emphasizes on collaboration between government bodies, healthcare organisations and professionals, and leverages technological advancements. The elementary step is to assess current capacities and vulnerabilities and then deploy investment and resource allocation accordingly for the upgrade of healthcare infrastructure.

* The key stakeholders who can implement the blueprint and benefit from it primarily include healthcare organisations, government bodies, healthcare providers and institutions with the supporting roles of technology service providers.

* 'Neighbourhood' is the impact scale of the blueprint as it considers contagious diseases primarily within the context of green buildings in areas sharing common resources.

* The risks outlined in the blueprint primarily focus on the failure of healthcare systems due to overloading, lack of healthcare personnel, medication and equipment. Limited accessibility of healthcare services, financial implications due to resource burden, rise in healthcare disparities and inequality are vital issues. On top of these, disruptions of clinical services and inadequate healthcare responses further aggravate the situation, emphasising the need for a comprehensive mitigation blueprint.
