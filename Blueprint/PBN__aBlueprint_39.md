# __Implementing Surface Disinfection Strategies__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Exposure to a wide range of contaminants, pathogens, and toxins on various surfaces and through different modes of transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_79.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The 'Blueprint' is positioned within the context of risk mitigation for contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These structures are designed to be environmentally friendly and are typically constructed from sustainable materials that promote efficient energy and water use. One pertinent risk arises from the potential spread of infectious diseases through contaminated surfaces within these properties. This risk is multi-faceted as people can be exposed and transmit diseases through various touchpoints such as stainless steel surfaces, frequently touched objects, floors, HVAC systems, public transport tools and more. These risk points underlie the importance of maintaining stringent cleanliness and ensuring effective disinfection throughout the environment.

* Whilst the spread of contagious diseases such as covid-19 via contaminated surfaces poses a universal threat, certain individuals are more directly impacted by these risks. Key stakeholders include visitors to these green buildings, the occupants living or working within them, healthcare workers servicing these environments, employees and people interacting with contaminated surfaces. Therefore, effective risk management strategies should be disseminated across these stakeholders given their direct involvement and potential encounters with disease transmission points.

* Fortunately, the blueprint provides a series of mitigation measures that can be effectively deployed to minimize this risk. First and foremost, the regular disinfection of surfaces forms the cornerstone of these strategies, augmented by the use of hygienic materials in these spaces. Quick and effective sanitization can be achieved through non-contact UV surface disinfection controlled by robots, thereby limiting human exposure. Alongside these actions, it's key to ensure regular and thorough cleaning of all surfaces. Additional protective measures like disinfection, sanitization and the provision of personal protective equipment also form part of this blueprint's proposed solutions.

* Implementing this blueprint yields numerous public health benefits backed by clear interventional logic. By ensuring the prevention of viral transmission through thoroughly disinfected surfaces, there would be a marked reduction in the disease's infectiousness within these green buildings. Consequently, the viral load borne by surfaces would be significantly lower, contributing to a safer environment for all occupants. The introduction of regular and considered cleaning measures therefore yields a significant payoff in terms of disease prevention and underscores the necessity of careful hygiene management in curtailing the spread of infectious diseases.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The blueprint is a comprehensive plan designed to minimize the risk of disease transmission through contaminated surfaces within green buildings neighbourhoods. It includes ensuring routine and thorough cleaning of surfaces, the use of hygienic materials throughout the premises, deploying robot-controlled surface disinfection systems to ensure a swift and effective sterilization process, along with employing personal protection essentials to limit contamination. This rigorous implementation will maintain a safe environment, preventing the spread of diseases and safeguarding the health of individuals that utilize or maintain these buildings.

* Facility managers, cleaning staff, building owners, and occupants have vital roles in implementing the blueprint's mitigation measures.

* 'Building'

* The blueprint outlines risks related to disease proliferation through various contaminated surfaces, including stainless steel surfaces, high-touch objects, floors, HVAC systems, and even personal protective equipment. This comprehensive document highlights the crucial task of maintaining sanitized environments to limit the spread of contagious diseases within green building neighbourhoods.
