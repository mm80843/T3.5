# __Implementing Real-time Epidemiological Data Collection and Analysis to Mitigate Virus Spread__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The fragmented and non-interoperable nature of data and knowledge, along with the lack of bioinformatics tools and data integration, hinder effective data management and sharing, leading to limitations in analysis, communication, and decision-making.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_71.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The blueprint encompasses a targeted response to a category of risks related to unavailable, unreliable or improper management and sharing of data, particularly as it pertains to disease spread in green-building neighborhoods. Green buildings, while being energy efficient, also pose certain challenges with regards to circulating ventilation and consequent propagation of air borne diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive data management and analysis program is essential to predict, prevent, and manage contagious diseases in these particular infrastructures.

* Several challenges are identified in this blueprint that underscore the need for implementing effective strategies. The primary risks include limited data availability, non-interoperable data, risks to data security and privacy, data capture challenges and more. These risks severely hinder informed decision-making when it comes to pandemic management and public health-related issues, especially in the context of green buildings. Moreover, the risks flesh out the requirement for standardized data structures, secured data linkages, and sophisticated computational approaches that can leverage the data to forecast disease trends and monitor their spread.

* This blueprint suggests numerous mitigation measures. Primarily, these involve the development of platforms and tools that facilitate real-time epidemiological data analysis and sharing. The utilization of the nCov2019 package, combined with real-time dashboards, would enhance data accessibility. These platforms would streamline data collection and analysis, leading to improved comprehension about the virus behavior and characteristics. Utilizing technologies such as IoT, AI, UV lamps, sensors, and machine learning, the proposed blueprint offers a comprehensive data management and analysis system.

* The benefits received from implementing this mitigation measure or blueprint, are multifold. It could lead to effective inactivation of viruses, particularly those airborne ones common in the context of green buildings, and therefore directly contribute to curbing disease spread. Applied as a tool for crisis management, the blueprint would also allow for real-time tracking, predicting, and controlling disease spread, and consequently reduce public health risks. This would facilitate the creation of a safer environment for the inhabitants of green buildings, improving public health outcomes and enabling smarter utilization of resources.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The 'Blueprint' aims to mitigate risks posed by contagious diseases in green-building neighborhoods. This solution entails creating a comprehensive data management and analysis system that provides direct access to real-time epidemiological data through advanced tools and platforms like the nCov2019 package and real-time dashboards. It employs technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) lamps and sensors. The objective is to gather reliable data on virus behavior and characteristics, understand potential risks, and monitor and manage the spread of disease effectively.

* Researchers, data scientists, governments, healthcare organizations, and data analysts are ideally equipped to implement the blueprint.

* Neigbourhood

* The blueprint emphasizes various data-related risks that may hinder effective pandemic management and public health in green-building neighborhoods. These risks include limited mobility data, challenges regarding data availability, sharing, and interoperability, insufficient data for analysis, data security and privacy issues, questions on data quality and reliability, difficulties in data capture, and fragmentation of data. These issues underline the crucial role of harmonized, thorough data-driven approaches in predicting and controlling the spread of contagious diseases in infrastructure.
