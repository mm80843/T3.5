# __Implementing Infrastructure Modifications and Community Engagement Strategies to Counter Contagious Diseases__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The effects of lockdown measures: exacerbated social inequalities, limited accessibility to green spaces, shifts in energy demands, work delays, adversity for startups, and mental health issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_61.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The Blueprint for mitigating risks in green buildings neighbourhoods amidst lockdown situations is a comprehensive guide catering to the multifaceted challenges implicated by strict movement restrictions. It particularly revolves around maintaining the physical and psychological well-being of the inhabitants while ensuring the smooth functioning of the green infrastructure. Lockdown situations exacerbate the existing disparities, amplify mental health concerns, reorient energy demands and present stumbling blocks for undertakings concerning infrastructure. Among the consequences experienced during lockdowns, disturbances caused by neighbor noise and certain sources such as bird noise also play a notable role in adversely affecting the individuals.

* A diverse range of risks needs to be addressed through this blueprint. Increased social inequalities, an escalated impact on mental health, reduced accessibility to green spaces leading to hampered well-being, and shifted energy demands pose challenges to the green buildings sector. Additionally, the delay in infrastructural works due to lockdowns presents a further setback. The phenomenon of neighbor noise irritation—stemming from general outdoor noise or other specific sources—compounds the negative effects arising from these lockdowns. These risks affect individuals living in home isolation, those living in the close vicinity of noisy neighbors or flats and patients in aiirs, among others.

* The mitigation measures proposed in the blueprint include the installation of devices controlling the movement of sliding doors to prevent unintended opening, especially vital for patients afflicted with mental ailments. It recommends extending financial support to the affected parties and ensures access to basic services. In order to minimize disturbances caused by noise, the blueprint suggests enhancing the building sound insulation guidelines and promoting respectful behavior among neighbors. Further, it advocates the improvement of sound insulation in flats and fostering community engagement for ensuring neighborly respect during the lockdown. Noise reduction strategies such as sound barriers or construction noise regulations also form an integral part of the mitigation measures.

* The implementation of these mitigation measures brings numerous advantages. It ensures a flexible approach to address the current challenges. The blueprint potentially reduces depressive symptoms induced by various factors including restricted movement and noise disturbances. Through weighed adjustments in energy demands, it facilitates improvements in energy efficiency. Consequently, the residential comfort in lockdown situations can be significantly elevated rendering the blueprint a worthwhile endeavor for local governments, ministries, building owners, and hospital administrations, among other stakeholders.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The blueprint for mitigating risks in green buildings neighbourhoods during lockdowns provides a comprehensive guide to address various issues. This includes social inequalities worsened by confinement, mental health impacts due to long periods of restrictions, shifts in energy demands, delays in infrastructure works, and dealing with neighbour noise. The proposed solutions include installing devices to control the opening of sliding doors, implementing noise reduction measures, improving sound insulation, and encouraging respectful neighbour behaviour. Additionally, it suggests ensuring essential services and providing financial assistance to those affected. To ensure this, we need to employ technologies including telecommunications and remote working technologies.

* The blueprint can be implemented by local governments, the Ministry of Commerce, the Saudi government, building owners, and hospital administrations.

* Building

* The blueprint lists risks including worsened social inequalities, mental health impacts due to extended lockdowns, changes in energy demand, delayed infrastructure works, complaints about neighbour noise, and heightened anxiety induced by the lockdown. All of these risks impact a wide range of individuals, from those in lockdown at home, to those in specific infection prevention units, to the general population. This approach to mitigation ensures a flexible approach to current challenges, potential reductions in depressive symptoms, and improved energy efficiency.
