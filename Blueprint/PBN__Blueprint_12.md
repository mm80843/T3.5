# __Resilience in staffing and skills training__

## Blueprint description

Even before the recent pandemic, most employers have developed strategies and tools for their employees to ensure gradual development of their skills while keeping their well-being at an acceptable level. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that these strategies and tools have not been resilient and flexible enough. Although employees have had to find their own responses to the impact of the pandemics, many organisations have begun to look for ways to improve resilience across the organisation through improved HR strategies and training.

## Capabilities of the blueprint

Nowadays, digital and conventional training methods are widely used. More and more companies specialise in developing various skills. In addition, Massive Open Online course platforms such as Coursera offer a range of relevant courses for free and can help build the resilience of organisations with limited budgets such as small businesses, schools or non-profit organisations

## Context of the blueprint

This measure can be implemented in all organizations, regardless of their size or sector. To meet the definition of resilience, the appropriate strategies and tools must be deployed from the outset and on an ongoing basis to prepare for potentially disconcerting events. Improving skills can be done virtually (through live or recorded training or training apps and games) or in person, and should be done continuously during calmer times

## Problem of the blueprint

When these strategies and tools are in place, employees are less affected by stressful, disruptive and unusual events and thus less hindered in their work process. Furthermore, a better understanding of market behaviour in times of crisis will help companies to organise their resources efficiently.

## Reason of the blueprint

Holistic and resilient human resource strategies and employee training give companies and other employers effective and much more flexible adaptation strategies for times of (not only) public health crisis. By improving their succession and transition plans and being able to replace the skills of one employee with those of a colleague, these organisations will be less vulnerable to potential disruptions in their activities. In addition, developing this measure will also improve employee engagement at different levels of the hierarchy and throughout the organisation by making them more independent and familiar with the tools that facilitate remote working

## Restrictions of the blueprint

There are a number of constraints that can hinder the effective use of resilience strategies and related training:
•	 the individuals developing the strategies may have inadequate backgrounds and may therefore make the strategies less effective. it is also important that the strategies are tailored to the needs of each organisation.
•	 some of the trainings may not be available due to high demand or the specificity of the topic
•	 smaller organisations may have budget and time constraints that make this intervention necessary
•	 with the abundance of trainings available, their quality may vary widely 
•	 moving training to virtual space isolates staff and can therefore hinder learning and growth
•	the biggest costs are the time and money required to develop the above strategies and training. However, compared to the potential costs of responding to and managing a crisis, these investments are negligible.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

Both companies and their employees can tap into a sustainable source of income. In addition, workers have the opportunity to benefit from a variety of other socio-economic and psychological advantages and to adapt to the new forms of work, such as more frequent home office.
