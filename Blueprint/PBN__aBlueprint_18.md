# __Implementing Drainage System Improvements and PCR Protocol Standardization to Mitigate Disease Spread__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The challenges of water pollution, inadequate wastewater management, and poor waste disposal require urgent attention for environmental sustainability.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_59.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The blueprint under discussion pertains to the management of infectious disease risks in green building neighborhoods, specifically focusing on issues related to water and waste management. Green buildings aim to minimize environmental impact through sustainable design and operations. While promoting health and well-being, these neighborhoods can also encounter unique challenges in managing infectious diseases. Diseases can proliferate due to deteriorating biodiversity, environmental contamination, pollution, and inadequate water and waste disposal systems. These concerns hold critical importance given the close-knit urban population, intricate water systems, and high waste generation in such precincts. 

* Numerous types of risks need to be addressed through this blueprint. Major threats involve poor surface water drainage leading to stagnant water bodies, becoming breeding grounds for waterborne diseases. Faulty waste management and insufficient filtration systems risk water contamination, endangering public health. Excessive water consumption and improper wastewater management might strain resources and result in re-contamination. Furthermore, a lack of advanced biosensors for pathogen detection and comprehensive wastewater analysis impedes timely disease control. Inadequate recycling and disposal systems may result in lingering environmental pathogens and compromised public health.

* The blueprint envisages several strategies to alleviate these risks. Fundamental to these strategies is the establishment of proper drainage systems and regular maintenance to prevent water stagnation. A comprehensive site selection procedure must be developed to avoid areas prone to flooding or stagnation. Also, reducing traffic volumes could limit environmental contamination. To effectively detect threats, the blueprint calls for the standardization of PCR platforms and protocols. Air filtration systems should be enhanced, preferably up to MERV-13 grade, and sealed effectively to prevent bypass, thereby avoiding airborne dissemination of pathogens. 

* The successful implementation of this blueprint offers numerous benefits. A significant improvement in air quality is achieved by installing and adequately sealing high-grade filters, which aids in the removal of disease-causing particles. Efficient wastewater testing and analysis can provide an early indication of virus circulation in the human population, facilitating timely interventions and reducing the burden on healthcare facilities. Ultimately, it allows green building neighborhoods to uphold their commitment to sustainability whilst ensuring their resilience against infectious diseases.


## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in green building neighborhoods to mitigate risks associated with water and waste management. The 'Blueprint' suggests solutions such as developing proper drainage and maintenance systems to avoid water stagnation and site selection procedures to avoid areas prone to flooding. Additionally, it encourages the reduction of traffic volumes to limit environmental pollution and suggests the installation of high-grade filters and sealing to avoid airborne diseases. Finally, it proposes standardization of PCR platforms and protocols for early detection of possible viral pathogens.

* The 'Blueprint' can be implemented by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, water utilities, researchers, building owners, and laboratory personnel.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks addressed in the 'Blueprint' include deteriorating biodiversity, environmental contamination, and pollution due to poor water and waste management. It also covers risks related to increased water consumption, improper wastewater management, and inadequate waste recycling. The 'Blueprint' identifies these as significant threats to the health and safety of individuals residing in green building neighborhoods.
