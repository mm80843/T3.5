# __Implementing Advanced Tech and Anti-Microbial Materials to Mitigate Contagious Disease Spread__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Efficient transmission of viruses, personal comfort, and access to local services are the common themes in this list.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_92.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The blueprint in discussion pertains to contagious disease mitigation, specifically targeting virus propagation in green building neighborhoods. It is a strategic plan that aims to address and neutralize potential threats of viral spread within compact, eco-friendly living spaces. Different stakeholders are identified as part of this blueprint, including building occupants, residents, cleaning staff and facilities, along with building management that oversees the operation and maintenance of these structures. 

* The risks identified in the blueprint are primarily of two categories: direct health risks linked to virus spread (Pvp1-Pvp6) and those linked to personal comfort and community services (Pc1-PC4, Lc1-Lc2), which indirectly influence disease susceptibility and transmission. Furthermore, risks attributed to environmental factors such as air and water quality and contamination (Aq1, Aq2, Aq4 and Wq1, Wq2, Wc1, Wc2) are identified as crucial elements that directly or indirectly impact health and well-being, thus, requiring immediate attention from the stakeholders. 

* The blueprint delineates a variety of mitigation measures combining technology with practical precautions and enhanced management. Smart technologies including motion sensors, keycard swipe systems, and UV-light based interventions are employed to reduce human interaction and ensure sanitary conditions. Regular monitoring of air conditions, innovative waste management and pressure sensors are proposed, along with the use of anti-microbial materials and incorporation of self-cleaning spaces. 

* Implementing this blueprint holds significant benefits for all stakeholders, primary among which is the reduced risk of infection, which directly correlates to better health among residents. Mechanized disinfection through technologies ensures sanitized living spaces without the need for human contact, reducing the potential for inadvertent virus transmission. Alongside, improved ventilation systems and reinforced control systems promise healthier and safer environments, making the green building neighborhoods a more attractive place for inhabitants.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I highly recommend the implementation of the "Blueprint" in practice to mitigate the risk of virus spread in green building neighbourhoods. This strategic plan involves both the adoption of smart technologies and modifications to building design and management, effectively reducing the chances of viral transmission. Increased use of touchless technologies and self-cleaning spaces, alongside more traditional means of infection control like optimal ventilation, form part of the approach. In addition, the adoption of anti-microbial materials and regular air quality monitoring further contribute to creating a safer environment. Therefore, this blueprint provides a comprehensive set of measures designed to tackle ongoing and future public health challenges whilst ensuring the comfort and convenience of residents.

* Building management and facilities are ideally suited to implement the blueprint.

* Neighbourhood

* The risks listed in the blueprint span from direct health threats such as potential virus propagation (Pvp1-Pvp6) to those related to personal comfort and provision of local services (Pc1-Pc4, Lc1, Lc2). Additionally, the blueprint identifies risks tied to environmental factors such as water and air quality and contamination (Aq1-Aq4, Wq1-Wq2, Wc1-Wc2), emphasizing that proper stewardship of shared resources and maintenance of clean, healthy environments are paramount for well-being and disease prevention.
