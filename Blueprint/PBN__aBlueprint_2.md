# __Implementing Effective Measures to Combat Contagious Diseases__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The repercussions of domestic violence, the pandemicâ€™s transmission, extreme events, population dynamics, and systemic vulnerabilities persist.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_51.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The context of this blueprint derived from the international concern over contagious diseases transmission in green building neighborhoods. Violent sections of the society, the virus's spread, the emergence of new variants, disastrous climatic anomalies, and weaknesses of delicate segments pose a threat to the peaceful existence in these regions. This blueprint thus aims to strategize mitigation measures against these risks.

* The listed risks comprise domestic and intimate partner violence, limited capacity of domestic violence services, and financial aspects as triggers of intimate partner violence. An urgent concern is the lack of authentic data on intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Similarly, the risks of the virus spreading, the surfacing of new variants, and the geographic spread are significant. Extreme events like severe weather patterns and black swan events cause disruptions, while population migration increases exposure to the virus. Other concerns include the lack of trust in presented evidence, inefficient evidence circulation, and exclusion of vulnerable groups, all underpinned by significant system vulnerabilities like the lack of community-level vector control capacity and passive survivability.

* The blueprint underlines a strategic approach for mitigating these risks. It suggests transparency and objectivity in evidence generation and communication to combat misinformation and build trust. It also indicates enhancing victim support services, awareness campaigns, and stricter legal and policy frameworks. Design buildings are recommended to incorporate passive design strategies and emergency facilities. Internet-based communication platforms, wearable devices, and IoT can be used creatively to monitor scenarios, maintain physical distances, and perform contact tracing.

* The implementation of this blueprint holds significant benefits. It is thought to radically decrease virus transmission, thus reducing financial losses incurred due to widespread illness. Lastly, the design changes in green buildings are projected to upscale their value - positively impacting the residential and real-estate industry. This carefully constructed mitigation blueprint, therefore, offers efficient measures to battle contagion-related risks while contributing to the wellbeing of green building populations.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I strongly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint', as it offers a strategic approach to mitigate a variety of risks related to diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. These risks include domestic violence, virus spread, new variants, extreme events, and vulnerabilities of certain populations. By maintaining transparency and objectivity in evidence generation and communication, combatting misinformation, and building trust through consistent and reliable delivery of evidence, 'Blueprint' enhances support services for victims, raises awareness, and strengthens legal and policy frameworks. It also anticipates pandemic impacts and measures their effect on areas of interest. Moreover, 'Blueprint' entails designing buildings with passive strategies and multiple bathrooms for emergencies.

* Government entities, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies are the stakeholders who can effectively implement 'Blueprint'.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks detailed in 'Blueprint' primarily concern certain societal issues and the virus's spread in green building neighbourhoods. The blueprint lists risks of increased domestic violence, limited capacity of violence services, financial strain, and lack of reliable data on violence during the pandemic. It also details risks associated with the virus's spread, identification of new variants, and its geographic distribution. In addition, the blueprint includes risks linked to extreme weather events and black swan events, as well as the risk associated with population movements and exposure to the virus. Another highlight of the blueprint is detailing vulnerabilities in the system, including the lack of community-level vector control capacity and passive survivability.
