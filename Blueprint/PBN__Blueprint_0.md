# __Rotating shift schedule__

## Capabilities of the blueprint

The good functioning of the rotational shift system is based on three main pillars:
• a shift booking system that assigns workers to specific groups depending onaccording to  the specific epidemiological situation
• education of users through information campaigns about the logic of this measure 
• a robust testing and shift coverage plan for a quick response time in case of infection in one of the groups

## Context of the blueprint

This measure should be used applied in enclosed and busy areas such as offices (during working hours) or large retail outlets during morning and evening rush hours and at weekends. For this measure to work, greater flexibility is envisaged on the part of the main actors - the workers - who should be willing to accept the restriction of their access.

## Blueprint description

During the COVID-19 pandemic, large organisations, as well as many educational public institutions, explored the potential to reduce disease transmission by dividing their staff (and students)and users into smaller groups that take turns using and servicing physical space in enclosed and high-traffic areas. The main idea is to introduce a rotating shift schedule in high occupancy areas, focusing on managing staff presence through shifts rather than the potential users of the services provided. Workers Staff should remain with the same shift group to reduce social mixing between groups of staff.

## Problem of the blueprint

Reduced possibility of disease transmission due to less crowded areas, less social mixing between staff groups, and reduced disruption of services due to unavailable labour.

## Reason of the blueprint

Limiting the occupancy of enclosed spaces allows for better social distancing. In addition, rotating the workforcerotation of staff prevents the transmission of diseases between the majority of staff, thus maintaining the final quality of service and bringing providing more flexibility to clients.  

## Restrictions of the blueprint

A number of limitations and constraints were identified for this specific measure:
•	 non-acceptance by users 
•	 change of behavioural patterns
•	 risk of duplication of resources - inefficiencies in the organisation could result in higher costs to end users to mitigate financial impact
•	 better planning needed, including testing for users
•	 misinformation
•	 slow response time
•	 number of users
