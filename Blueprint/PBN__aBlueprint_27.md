## Details of the blueprint

* As an expert in the field, I recommend the practical implementation of the 'Blueprint' strategy. This strategy aims to address potential contagious disease spread in public and green spaces, residences, and shared areas. It recommends steps such as enforcing physical distancing measures in buildings and public spaces, providing better access to green areas, and integrating outdoor spaces into residential and building designs. This also includes enforcing stricter maintenance and cleaning procedures in public areas. One simple and key part of this initiative is the idea of creating more balanced access to outdoor spaces for every resident. Implementing this blueprint would reduce the risk of contagious diseases spreading and improve overall public health.
* Anyone directly involved in the planning, development, and management of indoor and outdoor spaces can implement this blueprint. This group includes professionals like urban planners, local governments, building owners, architects, and facility managers.
* 'Neighbourhood'
* The risks identified in this blueprint are primarily linked with health and wellness as a direct outcome of the use, behaviour and design of our shared public spaces. These range from the danger of overcrowding in public spaces and buildings, lack of access to green areas, inadequate living conditions in residences, inappropriate conditions in office spaces, to many other interrelated risks. The overarching issue is the significant impact that these risks can have on the public, in particular, on mental health and on the spread of contagious diseases.

## Summary of the blueprint

* The Blueprint presented caters to the noticeable risk factors that revolve around space utilization in public places, green areas, inhabited spaces, and common areas. It pinpoints a variety of issues ranging from crowds in public zones, overcrowding, and transformations in the utilization and behavior in these areas. The risks also extend to topics related to green spaces, such as insufficient nurturing and limited accessibility. Additionally, the risks point out certain areas for improvement in living spaces, underscoring challenges like overcrowding, inadequate room, and lack of private areas. 

* The outlined risks in this Blueprint emphasize the significance of spaces and their impacts on various demographics inclusive of urban residents, building occupants, the general population, students, and employees. Within these spaces, risks pose themselves in several forms including insufficient funding for green spaces, inadequate cleaning policies in office establishments, and inappropriate indoor humidity levels. Consequently, the initiative prompts a reevaluation of access to outdoor spaces, equitable distribution of green space, and the creation of new designs and best practices for green spaces.

* To address these risks, the Blueprint proposes several mitigation measures. These include limiting the number of inhabitants in buildings through physical distancing measures and staggering schedules. Providing improved access to public parks, green spaces, and advocating for the development of these outdoor spaces in residential territories, and even integrating green spaces into building designs could help in mitigation. Enforcing limited occupancy and the use of disinfectants and cleaning products can ensure the safety of building occupants. The application of these measures, however, requires the cooperation and involvement of several key stakeholders such as urban planners, local governments, building owners, architects, and facility managers.

* Implementing the mitigation measures defined in this Blueprint offers a series of benefits. By reorganizing the relationship between living spaces and outdoor spaces, communities can experience improved mental well-being. Further, it enhances functionality and safety in built environments, laying the groundwork for healthier and more sustainable communities. Finally, these modifications offer the residents better access to nature and recreational spaces, contributing to an improved quality of life.
