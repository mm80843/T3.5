# __Implementing Disease Containment Strategies__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The construction industry faces challenges in occupant exposure, pandemic preparedness, information-based management, off-site construction, building systems, and financial crisis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_57.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The blueprint at hand addresses the manifold risks associated with contagious disease spread in infrastructure, with a particular focus on green building neighborhoods. It reflects the plethora of challenges and dilemmas faced by construction companies, occupants of residential buildings, contractors, project managers, and building occupants in Kuwait amidst the complex interplay between the construction industry and global pandemics. The severity and intricacy of these risks demand an efficacious and comprehensive mitigation plan.

* The risks underlined in this blueprint comprise a broad range, mirroring the multifaceted nature of actually erecting and maintaining green buildings during times of disease outbreak. These range from the mundane, such as a lack of understanding of social distancing measures or shortages of construction material, to more far-reaching ones such as environmental impacts of construction during a pandemic or resistance to new building systems and technologies. Moreover, the implications are not limited to health concerns. A host of financial and environmental issues add to the complexity of effectively managing such large-scale projects during pandemics.

* To manage these risks, the blueprint outlines a series of mitigation measures that can be unfolded across several layers of the construction project. First and foremost, implementing remote work arrangements and ensuring proper communication and coordination are crucial. Additionally, developing robust contingency plans and alternative timelines also play a vital role. The blueprint also emphasizes the importance of designing buildings in a manner that optimizes the size, location, and orientation of openings. Using occupancy sensors and other related technologies can decrease occupant density and increase social distancing – an essential need of today's world.

* Implementing these mitigation measures can lead to a spectrum of benefits. Increased productivity is one, owing to improved communication and collision of ideas. Moreover, such steps can minimize the damage from crises—financial, environmental, or health-related. Improved indoor air quality is a direct outcome of better building design and using appropriate materials, which in turn has a positive impact on overall health outcomes of the building occupants. Ultimately, these measures lead to more resilient building structures, healthier occupants and a more sustainable approach to managing construction and infrastructure in the face of contagious diseases.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* Given the outlined risks related to construction projects in green buildings neighborhoods during contagious diseases spread, it is recommended to implement the offered blueprint. In layman's terms, this blueprint offers a comprehensive plan to address various issues. It includes employing remote work possible areas, ensuring communication is effective and clear, creating contingency plans and timelines that can be adjusted depending on the situation. The blueprint also proposes designing buildings in such a way that the size, location, and orientation of openings are optimized to minimize mosquito access. Lastly, use of technology such as communication tools, layers, occupancy sensors, and collaboration tools are essential to the implementation of the blueprint.

* The blueprint can be implemented by construction companies, project managers, building owners, architects, and relevant government bodies.

* 'Building'

* The blueprint highlights a myriad of risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases in the infrastructure, particularly in green building neighborhoods. These oppositions include a shortage of materials for construction, challenges in transportation for construction workers, heightened costs and lower quality of resources, and a general lack of knowledge towards the necessary social distancing and safety measures that must be upheld during a pandemic. Other concerns related to delays in construction projects, financial crises within the construction industry, and environmental impacts from construction during a pandemic are given due importance as well.
