# __Drinking water safety - restoring water quality in buildings after forced closure__

## Blueprint description

During the Covid 19 pandemic, many buildings stood empty and were hardly used or not used at all. In addition, the lack of personnel in many cases led to a standstill in the maintenance of the water network. Under these conditions, standing and untreated water may no longer be potable or used for domestic or commercial purposes due to the growth of various pathogens and the depletion of disinfectants. In addition, changes in water chemistry can increase corrosion and leaching of metals such as lead and cause the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products. In this case, preventive measures must be taken to allow safe resumption of operation after a prolonged period of stagnation.
This BP describes a general procedure for the quality of drinking water in buildings before they are reopened in order to increase the resilience of the drinking water network, which includes the following steps: 
1) Inspection of the components of the water system, including the sources, the treatment plant, the distribution pipes and the distribution tanks (if applicable). It is advisable to contact the water utility to clarify the coordination of maintenance work.
2) Check all supply and consumption spilters and water softeners.
3) Flush the distribution system and all other relevant system components. Flush cold and hot water (until maximum temperature is reached) at all water tapping points (e.g. taps, showers, toilets, fountains and other drinking water consuming appliances), bearing in mind that the flushing time may vary depending on the pipe configuration.
4) If the drinking water system adds a chemical disinfectant during normal operation, disinfect the treatment system, including the storage tanks and pipes.
5) Take a sufficient number of water samples from different sources to assess the water quality throughout the distribution system before using the water.
6) Depending on the results of the previous step, consider whether further disinfection or heat treatment is required.
7) Consider informing building occupants of the condition of the water system and restricting access to water whose quality is unsafe. In this scenario, temporary on-demand water service providers may be considered.

## Capabilities of the blueprint

Water quality is closely monitored in Europe and North America; therefore, there are many resources for determining a reopening procedure tailored to the needs of a particular building or GBN.

## Context of the blueprint

This measure is to be implemented in all GBN buildings that have been closed for a longer period of time or are used seasonally.

## Problem of the blueprint

Water stagnation for weeks or even months as a result of building closures can cause the growth of microbial and chemical contaminants in water and affect the quality of drinking water.

## Reason of the blueprint

Safe drinking water infrastructure is essential for the proper operation of buildings or GBN. In a pandemic scenario, prolonged periods of closure can lead to bacterial growth contaminating and even clogging drinking water treatment systems if these systems are not properly restarted.
To address this potential problem, authorities recommend that building owners and managers take proactive measures to minimise water stagnation during forced closure periods and take steps to improve the building's water quality before reopening. Maintaining water quality helps to ensure that more complex remediation is not required prior to reopening.
In most cases, this problem can be solved by implementing procedures to flush and disinfect the building's sanitary facilities before reopening.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

If thorough quality control and disinfection of the drinking water network is required, external support may be necessary.
