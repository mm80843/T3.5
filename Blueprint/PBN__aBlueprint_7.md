# __Implementing Digital Tracing and Proactive Infection Control Measures__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The spread of infectious diseases and lack of understanding of transmission mechanisms contribute to the propagation of contagions, posing a global threat.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_55.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The 'Blueprint' presents a holistic approach towards managing and mitigating the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. Green building neighbourhoods refer to a community of buildings designed to be environmentally friendly, which could potentially foster an environment prone to the spread of contagious diseases. Certain aspects unique to green building neighbourhoods, such as shared spaces and systems designed for energy conservation, can inadvertently facilitate the transmission of diseases. This puts the general population, healthcare workers, residents, visitors, and especially vulnerable populations at an increased risk of infection. 

* The risks faced in such a setup are multifaceted. They encompass parameters like inadequate understanding of disease transmission mechanisms, inaccurate identification of infected individuals, inefficient disease identification, local and global disease diffusion, spread of other pathogens in hospitals, and underreporting of infections among others. They also involve more specific aspects such as transmission from infected individuals and the spread of zoonotic diseases. These risks are further amplified by fear of infection in urban green spaces and potential breaches of privacy that might result from attempts to track and control the spread of the disease.

* The prescribed mitigation measures in the 'Blueprint' address these risks effectively. These measures include the use of a digital contact tracing application and screening en masse. The measures assert the importance of implementing stringent infection control measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and enforcing social distancing to prevent the spread of the disease. These measures are backed by advancement in technology, including internet-based communication, wearable devices, use of Internet of Things (IoT), technology-enabled monitoring systems, physical barriers, and floor markings designed to enforce and maintain requisite physical distances.

* The implementation of such a blueprint fosters numerous benefits. The most significant is the reduction in the risk of infection and overall number of cases. It also helps improve asset value as public spaces and shared amenities in green building neighbourhoods become safer for use. At the fundamental level, it safeguards the health of the populace while promoting the concept of green and sustainable living, thus nurturing an environment of safety, health, and eco-conscious living. This perspective solidifies the necessity and the potential positive impact of the blueprint's implementation.


## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I would highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in practice. This blueprint proposes a comprehensive approach to managing and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases in green building neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods, built with an environmentally friendly design, sometimes unintentionally create spaces that could assist in disease transmission. To prevent this, the blueprint proposes several measures such as employing a digital contact tracing application, screening at a broad scale, implementing rigorous infection control measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and enforcing social distancing. These measures would be carried out with the help of technologies like internet-based communication, wearable devices, IoT, technology-enabled monitoring systems, physical barriers, and floor markings.

* The stakeholders who have the capacity to implement the blueprint include Governments, public health agencies, healthcare organisations, and building owners.

* Considering the nature of the impact, the scope of the blueprint is best described as 'Neighbourhood'.

* The risks described in the blueprint include factors that enhance disease transmission like inadequate understanding of disease transmission mechanisms, inaccurate identification of infected individuals, and inefficient disease identification. The blueprint also addresses issues related to local and global disease diffusion, spread of other pathogens in hospitals, underreporting of infections, as well as more specific aspects such as transmission from infected individuals and the spread of zoonotic diseases. These risks are heightened by fears of infection in urban green spaces and potential breaches of privacy in disease tracking and control.
