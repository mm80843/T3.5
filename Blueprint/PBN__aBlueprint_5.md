# __Implementing Early-Warning Systems and Safety Protocols Against COVID-19 Spread__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The assortment of hazards, dangers, exposures, vulnerabilities, and uncertainties that stem from different domains of life.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_83.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* In the context of green building neighbourhoods and urban environments, this 'Blueprint' puts forth particular focus on the mitigation of a variety of risk factors affecting human health and well-being. Such risks stem from different backgrounds such as physical health dangers, psychological risks, cybersecurity threats, and certain uncertainties, with particular attention to the spread of contagious diseases. Carrying the potential of impact across a broad range of demographics including tourists, the general population, healthcare workers, travelers, and governments, these risks thus necessitate effective and broad structures for mitigating and curbing impact.

* The risks, as illustrated in the 'Blueprint', engender both individual and communal health and safety issues, accentuated in healthcare settings, workplaces, and encompassing concerns such as obesity and sudden cardiac death. Besides, the psychological and security dimensions of these risks manifest in the form of biased risk perception and fallible risk communication strategies. Interestingly, the economic and financial realm is not spared either, with risks like insolvency and loan defaults presenting significant challenges. Given the wide range of arenas these risks cut across, the urgency for adopting this 'Blueprint' becomes clear.

* To combat the diverse risks at stake, the 'Blueprint' recommends a series of mitigation measures that are designed to alleviate population-level health and safety concerns. One key approach is leveraging early-warning systems, designed to keep tabs on the incidence of diseases like Covid-19. This is bolstered by implementing safety measures, promoting good hygiene practices, and availing accurate information to the public. Further, it advocates for robust risk management strategies, contingency plans, and enhanced communication and collaboration among supply chain stakeholders. Lastly, the provision of personal protective equipment and promotion of good hygiene practices make up additional mitigation measures.

* Executing the mitigation measures mapped out in this 'Blueprint' offers a cascade of benefits. These include significantly reducing the spread and importation of diseases. By engendering a healthier society, this not only ensures the wellbeing of individuals but could also reduce pressure on healthcare systems, and promote increased productivity across sectors. Furthermore, such an approach would lead to more robust and resilient communities that are better positioned to handle future health risks. This comprehensive multi-dimension risk mitigation framework contributes both to individual and communal safety and overall societal resilience.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The Blueprint recommendation focuses on the prevention and mitigation of varied risk factors that impact both, human health and wellbeing, on a communal and individual level. This implementation involves the usage of early-warning systems specifically for tracking incidences of contagious diseases such as Covid-19. Alongside this, it involves executing safety precautions, hygiene practices, accessibility to accurate information, comprehensive risk management strategies, and collaboration between supply chain stakeholders. Moreover, a part of the plan involves offering personal protective equipment and encouraging good hygiene practices to establish a safer environment for individuals.

* Stakeholders capable of implementing this Blueprint are diversified across different sectors including the tourism industry, governments, the hospitality industry, specific tourist destinations, and malaria elimination programs.

* Neighbourhood

* The pool of risks listed in the Blueprint comprises a rich array of threats to individuals and communities. These risks range from physical health hazards, psychological risks, and security threats to cyber-security vulnerabilities, uncertainties, and skewed risk perceptions. Also mentioned are the risks associated with economic and financial systems. Specifically, the blueprint discusses contagious disease related risks such as workplace transmission, the risk of sudden cardiac death, and the risk of obesity. In essence, the risks underscored in this Blueprint are both, diverse and impactful, befitting comprehensive mitigation.
