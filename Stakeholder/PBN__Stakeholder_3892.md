# __And academic institutions__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Limited access to diverse perspectives and marginalized populations in scholarly research](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8670.md)
* [Overreliance on highly-cited and high-volume segments of scholarship](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8672.md)
* [Overreliance on traditional citation-based metrics for journal evaluation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20656.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Absence of exploration of new construction-related research areas or streams due to covid-19.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4614.md)
* [Challenges in estimating urban mosquito species distributions and abundance, leading to poor estimation of urban disease exposure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4892.md)
* [Close similarities observed between historical guidance and 2007 guidance in pandemic preparedness planning.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5392.md)
* [Debate on the applicability and use of the wells-riley model for estimating infection risk during covid-19](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6160.md)
* [International mobility of scholars increases the risk of spreading contagious diseases across borders.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9366.md)
* [Lack of multi-disciplinary workgroups to address prioritized needs and problems in supply chain management](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15608.md)
* [Lack of unambiguous definitions of infectious disease terms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17874.md)
* [Most studies of airborne infection for covid-19 have generated risk estimates based on the wells-riley approach, which may not fully account for the complexity of dose-response models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19355.md)
* [Study of historical developments in a field may miss potential risks related to contagious diseases in the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20281.md)
* [Unexplored social media use of recovered covid-19 cases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20660.md)
