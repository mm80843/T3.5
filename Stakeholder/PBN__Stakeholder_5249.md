## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Development and survival of bacteria and mold in ventilation systems and air filters.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6263.md)
* [Historical average energy use decrease due to lockdown measures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7627.md)
* [Increased use of touchless technology and automation may lead to overreliance on these systems and neglect of manual cleaning and disinfection processes, resulting in higher transmission rates of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7628.md)
* [Longevity of the virus on different surfaces, increasing the risk of indirect transmission through touch.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7629.md)
* [Poor indoor air quality due to contamination from chemical and biological pollutants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9012.md)
* [Potential for the spread of contagious diseases within healthcare facilities due to suboptimal building automation and control systems bacs design and functionality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16747.md)
* [Potential transmission of contagious diseases via iot devices in large buildings or campuses.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17578.md)
* [Presence of odors in the building may indicate the presence of unsanitary conditions or mold growth, which can contribute to the spread of diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17653.md)
* [Transmission of contagious diseases through ventilation systems and air extractors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18206.md)
* [Ventilation systems that recirculate a proportion of indoor air can contribute to the spread of contagious diseases if not properly regulated.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19444.md)
