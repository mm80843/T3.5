* [Calculation of routes based solely on distance without considering contagious disease risk levels can lead to increased exposure to high-risk areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6374.md)
* [Collaborative learning without social distancing in classrooms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6384.md)

* [Higher secondary infection numbers in classrooms](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8794.md)
* [Identifying dangerous areas using heat maps can create a false sense of security if not accompanied by accurate and up-to-date data on contagious disease spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9023.md)
* [Inaccurate inference of occupation levels and transmission risk](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9026.md)
* [Inadequate ventilation in school facilities](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11922.md)
* [Inconsistent school closures and reopenings could lead to the spread of contagious diseases among students and staff.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13789.md)
* [Lack of research on the impact of vr and ar technologies on disease propagation in educational settings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13877.md)
* [Limited research period for assessing efficiency of hand-washing stations](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13878.md)
