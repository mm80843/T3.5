* [Increased demand for space in houses to accommodate work from home could lead to overcrowding and increased risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10676.md)
* [Unsustainable urban sprawl leading to inadequate pandemic response infrastructures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18283.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Historical pandemics like cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis, and the third plague pandemic have influenced the design and infrastructure of the built environment, potentially contributing to the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10364.md)
* [Interpersonal transmission risks due to inadequate indoor and outdoor points of interest pois in proportion to resident density and demands.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10663.md)
* [Lack of pandemic-resilient indicators in leed and well certification systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13200.md)

* [Transmission of contagious diseases in the built environment due to open floor plans and lack of privacy](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18317.md)
* [Uneven distributions of daily activities can lead to segregated subsets of the population, increasing the growth rate of infectious outbreaks.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20516.md)
