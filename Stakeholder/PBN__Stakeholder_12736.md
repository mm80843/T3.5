## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Dependence on convolutional neural network cnn architecture](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15759.md)
* [Inefficient spatial pooling operations may impact the accuracy and efficiency of the model](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15763.md)
* [Noisy estimation of mean and variance in batch normalization due to batch size reduction](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15771.md)
* [Overfitting may occur due to the use of specific techniques such as dropblock and class label smoothing.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15772.md)
* [Risk of overfitting in the neural network](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15773.md)
* [Selection and evaluation of activation functions may result in suboptimal model performance](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16074.md)
* [Use of data augmentation techniques such as mosaic may create a false sense of data variety and lead to overfitting if not used carefully](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16075.md)
