# __Modelers__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Assumptions necessary for the calibration of both the underlying crowd model and exposed](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7290.md)
* [Dependence on dynamic simulation model for time-dependent extension](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7321.md)
* [Dependence on parameter values](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7340.md)
* [Dependence on the assumption of constant exponential growth in early infection rates](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7364.md)
* [Overreliance on reduced-form statistical approach without consideration of underlying mechanisms and processes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8799.md)
* [Reliance on parameter values from the scientific literature](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9640.md)
* [Sensitivity of the exposed model to user assumptions for occupant exposure and k-multiplier](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9901.md)
* [Sensitivity to parameters with semi-arbitrary values](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9926.md)
* [Systematic errors bias in the modelâ€™s results due to inherent uncertainties and limitations in data inputs.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14345.md)
* [Time-varying models and factors introduce additional complexity and potential for error in modeling and estimation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15428.md)
* [Use of dynamic modeling and population-based kalman filter approach introduces a risk of model complexity and interpretation challenges.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15450.md)
* [Use of equation-based models to simulate the epidemic dynamics](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15451.md)
* [Use of outdated or invalid models](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17776.md)
* [Using a constant transmission rate assumption before the first lockdown may not accurately capture the changing transmission dynamics.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17974.md)
