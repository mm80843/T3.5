## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Avoiding air recirculation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6625.md)
* [Built environment can create conditions for the spread of specific diseases, such as legionnaireâ€™s disease, through factors like air conditioning, indoor plumbing, and hot water systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7791.md)
* [High reliance on deep learning-based solutions for monitoring social distancing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9829.md)
