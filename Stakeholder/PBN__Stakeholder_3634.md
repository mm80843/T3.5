# __Building design and public health research institutions__

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Inadequate focus on efficient and sustainable health engineering design systems may lead to the implementation of suboptimal building design strategies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4329.md)
* [Incomplete literature review may lead to oversight of important factors in building design for disease mitigation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4330.md)
* [Insufficient understanding of the impact of ventilation and air conditioning systems on disease transmission may result in ineffective building design](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4331.md)
* [Lack of data on different types of buildings and ventilation systems may result in incomplete understanding of their impact on disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4332.md)
* [Relying on simulation models without comprehensive data may lead to inaccurate or unreliable design principles for disease mitigation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4333.md)
