* [Lack of proper consideration for air circulation and ventilation in adapted parking spaces may lead to increased risk of contagion transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14076.md)
* [Right-angle parking configuration may lead to inefficient circulation and traffic flow within the adapted spaces, increasing congestion and reducing air quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14077.md)
