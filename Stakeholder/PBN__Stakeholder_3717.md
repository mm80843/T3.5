* [Increased time spent at home during the pandemic may have led to differences in temperature tolerances and influenced hvac use, impacting energy consumption and potentially increasing the risk of indoor air quality issues.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4769.md)
* [Insufficient hvac standards for diluting indoor air to prevent airborne pathogen transmission in high-occupancy facilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10136.md)
* [Limited use of germicidal irradiation in civil buildings](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10460.md)
* [Poor indoor air quality due to pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12264.md)
* [Spread of covid-19 in areas with ideal temperature and humidity for airborne transfer](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16550.md)
* [Underutilization of offices and commercial spaces during lockdown leading to ventilation issues and increased energy consumption.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20381.md)
