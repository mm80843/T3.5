# __And building managers__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Decrease in perceived outdoor noise level and increase in perceived neighbour noise level during the lockdown](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4268.md)
* [Inadequate design and placement of sinks leading to waste spillages](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6089.md)
* [Lack of consideration for new and transmissible sars-cov-2 variants in indoor spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6220.md)
* [Lack of understanding of the direct and indirect face-to-face communication reflected by the built environment be .](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12761.md)
* [Storage and display of output data](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19322.md)
