* [Regular data collection and monitoring of electricity use in housing units may lead to increased human contact in the built environment, potentially facilitating the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20370.md)
* [Submetering of building energy usage requires physical installation of ct coils on each circuit, potentially increasing the exposure of maintenance staff and installers to contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20371.md)
