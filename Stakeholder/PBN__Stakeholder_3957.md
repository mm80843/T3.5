* [Lack of evidence for the benefits of active transportation modes in relation to generalized biking and walking behaviors](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10668.md)
* [Lack of pre-event mitigation strategies for road networks](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15073.md)
* [Lowering the betweenness centrality could slow down the spread of future pandemics in over 70% of prefectural-level cities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19173.md)
* [Restricting access to travel and questing for alternatives to public transit](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19252.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Decreased traffic flow leading to improved air quality and reduced noise levels](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4669.md)

* [Global spread of infectious diseases through travel](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9647.md)
* [Hypothesized social distance may not reflect practical conditions, especially in spaces with strong population mobility or irregular shapes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10056.md)
* [Increased car ownership at the expense of mass transit, leading to higher emissions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11839.md)
* [Increased movement of people and goods may lead to the spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13681.md)
* [Lack of on-site operations and increase in offsite construction](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15005.md)
* [Lack of pre-event mitigation strategies for road networks](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19251.md)
* [Lack of social distancing and travel restrictions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19538.md)
* [Rapid spread of covid-19 due to unrestricted mobility and travel](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19939.md)
* [Restricting inter-city connections via railways may prevent the further spread of covid-19 in most cities of all levels.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20101.md)
