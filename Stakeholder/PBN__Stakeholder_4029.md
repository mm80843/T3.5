# __Health experts__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Concerns about the level of randomness in human behaviors in the simulation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4834.md)
* [Difficulty in browsing large contact tracing datasets leading to inefficient data analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4901.md)
* [Focus on small spaces with simple geometry in existing virus transmission simulations](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9271.md)
* [Inadequate understanding of the relationship between built environments and covid-19 transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14858.md)
* [Lack of clear and commonly accepted definition of ’healthy building’](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19415.md)
* [Lack of consideration for micro-level behaviors such as breathing and touching in covid-19 transmission scenarios](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19416.md)
* [Lack of quantification of simulated output leading to inability to score design options based on contamination or infection rate.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19421.md)
* [Reliability and consistency of data collection and analysis may overlook the impact of contagious diseases and their influence on project management and value engineering](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19451.md)
* [Relying solely on macro-level mobility aspects in the simulation without considering micro-level interactions within environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19453.md)
* [Uncertainty about virus transmission via surfaces and the effectiveness of prevention measures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19456.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Default simulation time step may not be optimal for modeling contagious diseases with different transmission rates and behaviors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4742.md)
* [Inadequate validation of simulation accuracy may result in unreliable outcomes and recommendations for safe space design and policy-making.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19407.md)
* [Lack of understanding of the impact of buildings on occupant health](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19429.md)
* [Potential spread of contagious diseases due to lack of knowledge about virus transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19430.md)
