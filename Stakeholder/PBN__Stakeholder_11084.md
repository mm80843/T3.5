* [Competitive nature of funding calls overlooks certain eu regions, leading to limited participation from those areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13587.md)
* [Knowledge scouting activities are not included, leading to delayed evidence production and limited confirmation of scientific importance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13588.md)
* [Lack of standard wording for broad informed consent may hinder data sharing and collaboration in research projects.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13589.md)
