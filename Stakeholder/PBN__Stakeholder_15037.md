# __Simulation users__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Customization of occupant properties may lead to inaccurate simulation of virus spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19438.md)
* [Default values for virus properties may not reflect the characteristics of a specific virus, leading to inaccurate simulation results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19439.md)
* [Inadequate simulation configuration leading to inaccurate results](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19440.md)
* [The visualization methods may oversimplify the complexity of virus transmission in the built environment, leading to misinterpretation of simulation results.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19442.md)
