## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Automatic generation and distribution of weekly reports may lead to complacency among users in conducting their own detailed follow-up diagnostics, potentially overlooking critical issues in indoor environmental quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16774.md)
* [Limited availability of historical data through the dashboard may hinder comprehensive analysis of building performance, including the tracking of long-term trends and patterns in indoor environmental quality.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16775.md)
* [Real-time updates and dynamic content may encourage user interaction but also increase the risk of contagious disease propagation if the dashboard is accessed by infected individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16776.md)
