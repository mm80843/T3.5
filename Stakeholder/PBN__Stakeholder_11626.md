## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Data security and privacy risks associated with the large amount of simulation data stored in a sqlite database.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14299.md)
* [Default simulation time step may not be optimal for modeling contagious diseases with different transmission rates and behaviors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19399.md)
* [Focus on small spaces with simple geometry in existing virus transmission simulations](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19400.md)
* [Inadequate validation of simulation accuracy may result in unreliable outcomes and recommendations for safe space design and policy-making.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19429.md)
* [Lack of detailed exploration of human-building interactions in simulation tools.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19430.md)
* [Limited flexibility for customizing configurations within the simulation tool](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19431.md)
* [Population size in the simulation not specified](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19452.md)
* [Reliance on existing data may lead to overestimation of simulation validity and not account for behavioral influences.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19453.md)
