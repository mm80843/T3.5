# __Resilience experts__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [General applicability of the resilience triangle metric may lead to misapplication in different contexts](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9607.md)
* [Inaccurate resilience measurement due to deterministic static metric](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9608.md)
* [Resilience formula considers both pre-disaster and post-disaster activities, leading to a more suitable measurement for engineering systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9634.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [General applicability of the resilience triangle metric may lead to misapplication in different contexts](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9603.md)
* [Inaccurate resilience measurement due to deterministic static metric](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9607.md)
* [Lack of specificity in accounting for recovery time in the formulation of resilience metrics](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9608.md)
* [Resilience metric that does not consider time to recover, leading to inaccurate assessment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9618.md)
* [Use of semi-quantitative indices to assess resilience may lead to oversimplification of complex systems and miss important factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9619.md)
