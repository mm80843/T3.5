* [Risk of contagious diseases propagation in the built environment due to urban policies and proximity perspectives](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20482.md)
* [Shift in homebuyer preferences and housing locations due to covid-19 could lead to spread of contagious diseases in new residential areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20483.md)
* [Visiting parks on weekends and weekdays without a preference may lead to crowded spaces, increasing the risk of disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20552.md)
