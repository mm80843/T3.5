## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Assuming an infection-fatality ratio of 0.75% without accounting for asymptomatic infections.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6160.md)
* [Contrary to other pollutants, higher levels of o3 and so2 from satellite and ground data were not associated with more covid-19 deaths and mortality rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6467.md)
* [Differences in patterns of movement of crowds and levels of economic development make it difficult to clarify which country’s data are most appropriate for simulating the trend of covid-19.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6921.md)
* [Failure to identify statistical differences in disease prevalence between countries and regions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7363.md)
* [High level of uncertainty in estimating the effective reproduction number, rt, in italy around the time of lockdown.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8727.md)
* [Inclusion of mobility data from wuhan resulting in improved model prediction](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8728.md)
* [Lack of quantitative data on covid-19 impact in the construction industry.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8755.md)
* [Limitations of self-reported compliance data](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9880.md)
* [Limited external validation of anomaly detection models may result in overfitting to specific datasets, reducing the models’ generalizability and reliability.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9951.md)
* [Model comparison may lead to incorrect conclusions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12361.md)
* [Most studies of airborne infection for covid-19 have generated risk estimates based on the wells-riley approach, which may not fully account for the complexity of dose-response models.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12721.md)
* [Reliance on a technology-driven approach without addressing underlying social and behavioral factors may overlook the root causes of non-compliance with mask-wearing rules.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12891.md)
* [Reliance on data from countries with more advanced epidemics and earlier interventions, such as italy and spain.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16069.md)
* [Reliance on semi-mechanistic approach with parameters estimated empirically and with strong prior distributions or fixed assumptions.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16850.md)
* [Substantial heterogeneity in study results](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20091.md)
* [Variability in growth rates due to multiple factors](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_20407.md)
