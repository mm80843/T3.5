# __Design teams__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Selection of a site near an open surface water body increasing the number of breeding sites for the malaria vector](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17293.md)

## Risks that can be mitigated by this stakeholder

* [Inadequate analysis of space occupancy and human behavior](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17293.md)
* [Lack of ability to analyze decisions within the context of relevant human-building interactions and their relationships to potential virus spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17294.md)
* [Lack of consideration for virus transmission in early design evaluation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17295.md)
* [Placement and size of building openings affecting vector accessibility](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19472.md)
* [Reliance on already constructed and occupied environments for research](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19473.md)
* [Selection of a site near an open surface water body increasing the number of breeding sites for the malaria vector](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19474.md)
* [Use of materials that increase vector attraction into the site](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19483.md)
