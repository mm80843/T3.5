# __And building management__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Dependence on limited literature for understanding vulnerabilities of office buildings to covid-19 diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5641.md)
* [Formation of a large number of terraces and gardens increases the potential for social gatherings and close interactions, leading to a higher risk of contagion.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5642.md)
* [Limited access to common areas in dense urban areas may hinder the implementation of disease mitigation measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5655.md)
* [Shared common spaces for socialization may become hotspots for disease transmission if not properly managed and maintained.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_13832.md)
* [Spatial separation and narrow corridors can create bottlenefks and bottlenecks that increase the likelihood of close contact and the spread of pathogens between individuals passing through the area.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16437.md)
