# __Resilience researchers__

## Risk affecting this stakeholder

* [Failure to consider extra penalty for performance loss and recovery time exceeding maximum acceptable values.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9613.md)
* [Inability to quantify resilience value within a range of 0 and 1 for dynamic resilience.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9630.md)
* [Inadequate exploration of linkages between smart solutions and multiple resilience abilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9631.md)
* [Incorporation of multiple hazards into the resilience measurement approach.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9632.md)
* [Limited examination of whether deployment of smart solutions may detract from resilience abilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9663.md)
* [Uncertainty in quantification of resilience](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14646.md)
* [Use of fuzzy cognitive maps fcm could lead to inaccurate representation of causal reasoning for engineering resilience factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14647.md)
