# __Unsupervised machine learning used to segment data into infectious and noninfectious periods, leading to potential misclassification of covid-19 infection periods.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Cheong_wearable_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_435.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement supervised machine learning with labeled infectious and healthy periods to ensure accurate classification of covid-19 infection periods.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_8798.md)

## Name of the risk

Misclassification of infectious periods could result in failure to detect and isolate COVID-19 cases, leading to increased transmission.
