## Description of the risk

The effectiveness of upper-room UVGI in disinfecting the air is dependent on good air mixing between the upper and lower portions of the room space

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement strategies to promote good room air mixing, such as ceiling mounted fans, to ensure even distribution of aerosol particles in the uv field](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_1623.md)

## Name of the risk

Inadequate air mixing can lead to areas in the room where larger aerosol particles are not exposed to the UV-C light, reducing the overall effectiveness of the system
