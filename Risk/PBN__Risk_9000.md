# __The study involves analyzing energy consumption in buildings, which could be a potential indicator of building occupancy and human activity, both of which contribute to the spread of contagious diseases.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Geraldi_addressing_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_475.md)

## Mitigations of this risk
