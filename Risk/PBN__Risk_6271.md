# __Deployment of smart ieq sensor nodes anywhere in the premises may lead to incomplete or uneven coverage of monitoring.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Calvo_scalable_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_427.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Strategically plan the placement of sensor nodes based on building layout and occupancy patterns. use a combination of fixed and mobile sensor nodes to ensure comprehensive coverage.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_8143.md)

## Name of the risk

Uneven coverage can result in inadequate assessment of IEQ across the entire built environment, leading to problems in identifying and managing environmental health risks.
