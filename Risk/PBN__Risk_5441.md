# __The assumption that the room air is well mixed may not hold true in all situations, leading to inaccurate calculations of average particle residence time and irradiation flux.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Beggs_upper-room_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_413.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Conduct a thorough assessment of the roomâ€™s ventilation system and airflow patterns to ensure that the assumption of well-mixed air is valid. consider using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations to model air circulation in the room.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_7314.md)

## Name of the risk
