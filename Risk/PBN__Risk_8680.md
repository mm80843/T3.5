# __Challenges in implementing optimal mitigation policies to reduce peak healthcare demand and deaths.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Ferguson_report_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_469.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Combine home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living with suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and high-risk individuals to mitigate peak healthcare demand and reduce deaths. consider implementing suppression strategies if possible.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10573.md)

## Name of the risk

Despite mitigation efforts, the resulting epidemic may still lead to significant healthcare demand, overwhelming health systems and resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
