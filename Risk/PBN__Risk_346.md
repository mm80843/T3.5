# __Lack of access to urban green space during covid-19 pandemic__

## Blueprints with this risk

* [Acces to green space](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Blueprint/PBN__Blueprint_2.md)
* [Adapted architectural design](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Blueprint/PBN__Blueprint_8.md)
* [Public places as information points](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Blueprint/PBN__Blueprint_16.md)

## Category to which it belongs

* [Urban areas suffer from a scarcity of accessible and diverse green spaces, contributing to disparities, inadequate quality, and decreased visitation, while also exacerbating health issues and environmental concerns.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_81.md)
