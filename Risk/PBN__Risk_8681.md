# __Risk of overwhelming health systems due to high transmission rates and uncontrolled epidemic growth.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Ferguson_report_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_469.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement strict suppression strategies to reverse epidemic growth, reduce case numbers to low levels, and maintain that situation indefinitely. this may involve strict lockdowns, travel restrictions, and other measures to reduce transmission rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10574.md)

## Name of the risk

High transmission rates and uncontrolled epidemic growth can overwhelm healthcare systems, leading to shortages of intensive care units, medical supplies, and healthcare personnel.

## People affected by this risk

* [And vulnerable populations reliant on healthcare services](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_68.md)
* [Healthcare workers](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_7183.md)
* [Patients in need of intensive care](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_7184.md)

## Stakeholders who can mitigate this risk

* [And healthcare organizations responsible for implementing and sustaining strict suppression measures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_0.md)
