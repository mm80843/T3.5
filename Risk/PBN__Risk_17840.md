# __Recirculation of air in the built environment during an epidemic, including covid-19, can lead to the dissemination of virus-laden particles.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Morawska_how_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_641.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Avoid recirculation of air by maximizing outdoor air levels, applying filtration or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to remove or deactivate viral contamination, and installing secondary air circulation systems with outdoor ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_19801.md)
