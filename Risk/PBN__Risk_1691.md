## Description of the risk

Influenza transmission primarily occurs indoors, within a narrow range of temperatures and AH levels.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Properly regulate indoor temperature and ah levels to reduce influenza transmission. improve ventilation and air filtration systems.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_2265.md)

## Name of the risk

If indoor environments are not properly regulated, it can lead to increased influenza transmission.
