# __Using state-specific stringency index and compliance indicator to bring the basic reproductive number r0 to less than 1 in each state studied.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Mukerjee_mitigation_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_639.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Thorough validation and calibration of the stringency index and compliance indicator using real-world data and simulations to ensure their effectiveness in reducing r0.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_19754.md)

## Name of the risk

Failure to accurately estimate the impact of Stringency Index and Compliance Indicator may result in an inadequate reduction of the basic reproductive number, leading to continued disease transmission.
