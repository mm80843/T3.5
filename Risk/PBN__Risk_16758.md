# __Lack of auditing and design evaluation of bacs in smart buildings leading to large energy performance gaps and suboptimal control systems.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Pedersen_assessment_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_614.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement thorough auditing and design evaluation of bacs in smart buildings to ensure optimal control systems and energy performance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_18705.md)

## Name of the risk

Buildings not meeting design requirements and systems drifting from initial design standards, potentially contributing to energy inefficiency and increased risk of contagion propagation.
