# __Significant spatial scale effect of non-contact interaction activities may lead to complex and variable impacts on community service facilities.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Wang_urban_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_517.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Utilize spatial analysis and modeling to understand the spatial scale effect of non-contact interaction and optimize the location and distribution of community service facilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_13806.md)

## Name of the risk

Without considering the spatial scale effect, community service facilities may not be strategically located to meet the changing needs of residents.

## People affected by this risk

* [Community residents who rely on these service facilities are at risk](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_9772.md)

## Stakeholders who can mitigate this risk

* [And local government authorities can implement the mitigation strategies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_125.md)
* [Architects](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_431.md)
* [Urban planners](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_9773.md)

## Technologies linked to the risk

* [Geographic information systems gis and advanced spatial modeling tools can be used to analyze and visualize the spatial scale effect](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Technology/PBN__Technology_13987.md)
