# __Inadequate daylighting and lack of regulation of human circadian clock due to poor environmental design in residential spaces.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Peters_how_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_612.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement small adaptations such as painting walls white, reorganizing occupant activities closer to windows, and discouraging the use of windowless spaces as dwellings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_18501.md)
