# __Incorrect computation of average irradiation flux may result in insufficient uvgi exposure to achieve the desired survival fraction of microbes.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Beggs_upper-room_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_413.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Regularly monitor and calibrate uvgi systems to ensure that the computed average irradiation flux aligns with the desired survival fraction of microbes. consider implementing real-time monitoring and feedback control systems for uvgi exposure.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_7316.md)

## Name of the risk

Insufficient UVGI exposure may lead to incomplete disinfection and allow for the persistence of contagious microbes in the room.
