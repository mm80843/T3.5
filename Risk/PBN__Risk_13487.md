# __Spatial heterogeneities in movement patterns and predicted malaria risk lead to variations in relative rates of infection movements, contributing to malaria spread.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Tatem_integrating_2014](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_548.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement targeted vector control measures based on movement patterns. conduct surveillance and monitoring of infection movements in high-risk areas to detect and respond to outbreaks quickly.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_15411.md)

## Name of the risk
