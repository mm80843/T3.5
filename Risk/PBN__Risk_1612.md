## Description of the risk

Symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the spread of the virus and make it challenging to control its transmission.

## Type of the risk

* [Physical](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/RiskHealth/PBN__RiskHealth_0.md)

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Type of impact of the risk (according to ISO37100)

* [Safety and security](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Purpose_5.md)

## Type of purpose of the risk (according to ISO37100)

* [Health and care](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Impact_3.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Increased testing capacity, contact tracing, and public health campaigns to promote preventive measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing can help mitigate the risk.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_2163.md)

## Name of the risk

The presence of symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers increases the risk of transmission and makes it difficult to identify and isolate infected individuals.
