# __Uv radiation mapping shows variability in uv exposure levels across the chamber.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Walker_effect_2007](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_523.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Regularly adjust uv exposure levels based on mapping data to ensure consistent and effective disinfection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_14126.md)

## Name of the risk
