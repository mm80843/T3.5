# __Limiting changes to certain building systems due to constraints may result in uneven distribution of energy efficiency improvements, leading to potential performance and health disparities within the building.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Pedersen_assessment_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_614.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implementing strategies to address disparities, such as zoning control, maintenance priority planning, and targeted improvements in constrained areas.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_18606.md)

## Name of the risk

Unequal energy efficiency improvements can result in areas of the building being more susceptible to poor indoor air quality and uncomfortable temperatures.
