# __Inadequate airflow and ventilation in indoor spaces can lead to poor air quality and increased risk of disease transmission.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Elsaid_critical_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_463.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Position air outlets to ensure good airflow without directly blowing air into occupied areas, and consider the cooling capacity of the unit to ensure proper airflow.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10210.md)
