## Description of the risk

Larger aerosol particles may decouple from the air stream due to gravitational deposition or remaining suspended in the breathing zone, reducing their exposure to the UV-C light

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Use computational fluid dynamics cfd to assess the limitations of the upper-room uvgi system in disinfecting larger aerosol particles](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_1624.md)

## Name of the risk

The decoupling of larger aerosol particles undermines the effectiveness of the upper-room UVGI system in disinfecting the air
