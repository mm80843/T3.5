# __Incomplete coverage of epidemiological terms in obo bio-ontologies may hinder interoperability and consistency in data representation.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Queralt-rosinach_covid-19_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_602.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Continuously update and enrich existing ontologies, establish a standardized process for term inclusion, and implement axioms and definition patterns for better integration with clinical ontologies.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_18057.md)
