# __Inadequate consideration of heterogeneity parameters and densities in the regression model could lead to inappropriate characterizations of unobserved factors related to contagious diseases.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Frank_treating_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_471.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Comprehensively test different densities such as normal, lognormal, triangular, uniform, and weibull distributions to identify the most suitable characterization for unobserved factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10726.md)

## Name of the risk

Inappropriate characterizations can result in incorrect policy recommendations and ineffective disease control measures.
