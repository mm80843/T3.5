## Description of the risk

Use of traditional materials (mud walls, thatched roofs, etc.) in construction increases the attractiveness of buildings to mosquitoes, increasing the risk of malaria transmission.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Research and develop alternative materials that prevent mosquito attraction while remaining environmentally sustainable.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_2417.md)

## Name of the risk

Increased risk of malaria transmission due to the use of traditional building materials.
