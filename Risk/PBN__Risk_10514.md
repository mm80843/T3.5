# __Ventilation alone cannot prevent indoor airborne transmission.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Zhang_review_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_500.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement complementary measures such as air filtration, uvgi systems, and ventilation controls to supplement the effectiveness of ventilation in preventing indoor airborne transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_12425.md)
