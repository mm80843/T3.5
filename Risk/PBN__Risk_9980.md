# __Varied efficacy of copper surfaces based on copper content and form native, nanoparticle raises concerns about the uniformity of antiviral properties across different copper materials.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Hutasoit_sars-cov-2_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_492.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Standardize testing procedures to evaluate the antiviral properties of different types of copper, and communicate clear guidelines on the recommended copper materials for virus mitigation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_11887.md)

## Name of the risk

Confusion about which type of copper material is most effective in inactivating viruses, leading to inconsistent mitigation efforts.
