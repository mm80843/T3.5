# __Antiviral drugs like tamiflu and relenza are stockpiled globally and deployed during pandemics, leading to high proportions of communities taking the drugs in a short time window, resulting in the drugs and their metabolites being present in wastewater.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Sims_future_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_566.md)
