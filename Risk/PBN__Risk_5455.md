# __Irradiating the coronavirus in liquid requires a uv-c dose that is in the region 1.8-6.0 times higher than that required when the virus is suspended in air.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Beggs_upper-room_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_413.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Develop uv-c dose calibration methods specifically for liquid suspension scenarios.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_7328.md)

## Name of the risk

Higher UV-C dose requirement for liquid suspension increases the difficulty in virus disinfection.
