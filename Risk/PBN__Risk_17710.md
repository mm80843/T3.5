# __The south african study demonstrated that achieving greater protection from airborne pathogens through air changes ach became increasingly challenging, with smaller increments in protection requiring significantly higher equivalent air changes.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Explore alternative air disinfection technologies and strategies to complement ventilation, and consider the integration of multiple control measures to optimize airborne pathogen control.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_19670.md)

## Name of the risk

Increasingly high equivalent air changes for small increments in protection indicate the limitations of relying solely on ventilation for airborne pathogen control in built environments.
