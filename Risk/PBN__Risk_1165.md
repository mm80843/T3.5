## Description of the risk

There is not enough scientific evidence to prove that upper-room UVGI is effective at inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the air

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [No](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_0.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Conduct more research and studies to gather sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of upper-room uvgi against sars-cov-2](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_1621.md)

## Name of the risk

The lack of evidence hinders the implementation of upper-room UVGI as a viable intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in buildings
