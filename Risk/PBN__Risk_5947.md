# __Potential for rapid transmission of pathogens across distant neighborhoods due to uneven distribution of activity hubs in a city.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Brizuela_understanding_2019](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_421.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Evenly distribute activity hubs throughout the city to segregate subsets of the population and inhibit rapid transmission of pathogens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_7817.md)

## Name of the risk
