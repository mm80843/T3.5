## Description of the risk

Overcrowded spaces with high occupant density increase the risk of droplet transmission and close contact with infected individuals.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Manage occupant density, promote physical distancing and use space management strategies to control occupancy rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_3106.md)

## Name of the risk
