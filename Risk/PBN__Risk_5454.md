# __Aerosolised viruses appear to be more vulnerable to uv damage than when they are suspended in a liquid or on a substrate.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Beggs_upper-room_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_413.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement targeted uv-c disinfection methods for viruses suspended in liquid.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_7327.md)

## Name of the risk

Greater difficulty in disinfecting viruses suspended in liquid compared to those suspended in air, leading to higher risk of transmission.
