# __Estimation of wastewater loading and population density could result in inaccurate representation of actual wastewater flows and population exposure to contaminants.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Hart_computational_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_483.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Regular validation and update of wastewater loading and population density data, considering factors such as demographic changes and industrial activity.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_11301.md)

## Name of the risk

Inaccurate modeling could lead to insufficient capacity in the collection system, increasing the risk of system overload and potential exposure to contaminants for the population.
