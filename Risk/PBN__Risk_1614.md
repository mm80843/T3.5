## Description of the risk

The low sensitivity of current assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples can result in false negative results and hinder accurate monitoring of virus circulation in the population.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Improvement of assay sensitivity through the development and implementation of more sensitive and specific assays for sars-cov-2 detection in sewage samples.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_2165.md)

## Name of the risk

Low sensitivity of assays can lead to underestimation of the presence and extent of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population, hampering effective public health interventions.
