# __Inference on model parameters for spatial locations based on covid-19 transmission dynamics may lead to biased or oversimplified conclusions about disease transmission in different geographical areas.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Perez-saez_effect_2022](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_613.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Incorporation of detailed regional data and context-specific factors into the modeling framework to capture the heterogeneity of covid-19 transmission dynamics across different spatial locations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_18557.md)

## Name of the risk

Biased or oversimplified conclusions may result in inappropriate allocation of resources and NPIs, leading to ineffective control of disease transmission in certain regions.
