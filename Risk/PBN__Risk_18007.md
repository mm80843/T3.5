# __Operators mutate the components of a chromosome, generating new chromosomes, which may introduce new genetic defects.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Mokhtari_effect_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_643.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Perform thorough validation of the mutated chromosomes to ensure they do not introduce genetic defects, and employ robust quality control measures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_19969.md)

## Name of the risk
