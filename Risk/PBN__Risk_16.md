## Description of the risk

Densely populated urban areas provide optimal conditions for the spread of pathogens. Promoting a more horizontally distributed urban development can decrease epidemic risk.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Horizontal urban development](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_20.md)
* [Promote a more horizontally distributed urban development. ensure adequate housing and living conditions to minimize crowding.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_3084.md)

## Name of the risk

Higher risk of pathogen transmission and rapid spread of infectious diseases.
