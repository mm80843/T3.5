# __The use of aggregated observation and simulated variables over longer time periods for model calibration may overlook short-term fluctuations and dynamics in disease transmission, leading to limited accuracy in capturing real-time epidemic trends.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

## Name of the risk

Limited accuracy in capturing real-time epidemic trends may hinder timely implementation of NPIs and response strategies, resulting in delayed control of disease transmission and potential resurgence of outbreaks.
