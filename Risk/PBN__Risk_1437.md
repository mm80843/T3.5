## Description of the risk

Clinical testing of individuals for COVID-19 is expensive and slow, while wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) offers a rapid and cost-effective alternative.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement wbe surveillance as a cost-effective and rapid tool for population health assessment and monitoring.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_1958.md)

## Name of the risk

Clinical testing is costly and impractical for population-wide testing, causing delays in assessing infection status.
