# __Unclear definition of terms such as ’neighbourhood environment’ and ’built environment’ may lead to inconsistent inclusion or exclusion of studies related to contagious diseases.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Twohig-bennett_health_2018](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_537.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Provide clear and specific definitions of terms related to the built environment in the screening and inclusion criteria for studies. use standardized definitions to ensure consistency in study selection.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_14832.md)

## Name of the risk

Inclusion of irrelevant studies may dilute the findings and conclusions of the systematic review, leading to inaccurate recommendations for disease mitigation in the built environment.
