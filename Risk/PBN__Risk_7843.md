# __Not all air-handling systems have capacity to substantially increase outside air ratios__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Dietz_2019_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_454.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Invest in air-handling systems with the capability to increase outside air fractions, or implement alternative measures to improve indoor air quality](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_9726.md)

## Name of the risk
