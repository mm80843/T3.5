# __Limited pathogen reductions through air disinfection measures, such as uv, result in less than 1 log of risk reduction, which may be insufficient for effective control of airborne pathogens.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Nardell_air_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_637.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Identify and implement additional air disinfection and ventilation strategies to achieve higher pathogen reductions, and conduct regular monitoring of pathogen levels to assess effectiveness.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_19669.md)

## Name of the risk

Inadequate reduction of airborne pathogens could lead to ongoing pathogen generation and increased risk of disease transmission within built environments.
