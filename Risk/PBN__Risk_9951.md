# __Assuming an infection-fatality ratio of 0.75% without accounting for asymptomatic infections.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Hsiang_effect_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_491.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Account for asymptomatic infections and vary the infection-fatality ratio in simulations to consider a range of possibilities.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_11858.md)

## Name of the risk

Failure to consider asymptomatic infections may lead to underestimation of total infections and inaccurate projections of disease spread.
