# __The use of spatial repellents in combating vector-borne diseases could lead to the development of resistance in mosquito populations, rendering the repellents ineffective.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Wilson_importance_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_510.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Rotation of different types of spatial repellents, development of novel repellent formulations, and surveillance of mosquito populations for resistance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_12800.md)

## Name of the risk

Resistance to spatial repellents could reduce their efficacy, leading to increased exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes.
