# __Relying solely on macro-level mobility aspects in the simulation without considering micro-level interactions within environments.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Lee_designing_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_672.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Develop a system that incorporates both macro-level and micro-level interaction simulations, considering individual and group behaviors within the built environment.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_21434.md)

## Name of the risk
