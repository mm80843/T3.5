# __Insufficient sampling depth and rarefaction leading to biased estimates of microbial diversity and composition.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Kembel_architectural_2014](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_687.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Carefully plan sequencing depth and rarefaction levels based on sample complexity. use statistical techniques such as rarefaction curves and extrapolation to assess sampling adequacy. consider targeted sequencing of specific taxa to improve coverage.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_22235.md)

## Name of the risk
