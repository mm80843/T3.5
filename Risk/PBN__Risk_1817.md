## Description of the risk

Inadequate drainage systems and poor water management can create stagnant water pools, which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk
