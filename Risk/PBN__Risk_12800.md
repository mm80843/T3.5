# __Insufficient consideration of human behavior and social dynamics in the designed physical spaces, leading to non-compliance with social distancing measures.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Ugail_social_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_534.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Incorporate behavioral science research and user feedback into the design process to create spaces that align with human behavior and social dynamics. use simulations and virtual models to test the effectiveness of social distancing arrangements in real-world scenarios.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_14719.md)

## Name of the risk

Increased risk of disease transmission due to human behavior that does not align with the designed space, potential overcrowding, and disregard for recommended spatial arrangements.
