# __Indirect association between pedestrian links per square mile and covid-19 mortality rate through street connectivity__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Frank_treating_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_471.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement measures to promote physical activity and address obesity in areas with high street connectivity to mitigate the indirect effects on covid-19 mortality rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10750.md)

## Name of the risk

Greater street connectivity is indirectly associated with a decrease in COVID-19 mortality, but also with increased obesity, which could lead to higher COVID-19 mortality rates.
