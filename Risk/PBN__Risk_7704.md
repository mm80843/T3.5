# __Lack of knowledge about the half-life persistence of virus markers in wastewater and its impact on sampling methods and measurement accuracy.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Daughton_wastewater_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_450.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Conduct research to determine the half-life of virus markers in wastewater and how temperature influences their persistence.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_9585.md)

## Name of the risk

Risk of using trailing measures of infection if the half-life of markers is too long, leading to inaccurate assessments of infection levels.
