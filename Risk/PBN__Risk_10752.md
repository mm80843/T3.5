# __Variations in pmmov concentrations across samples without understanding the stability over time for the catchment population.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Wu_sars-cov-2_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_507.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Conduct studies with more wastewater samples over a longer period to understand the stability of pmmov loading for the catchment population.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_12663.md)

## Name of the risk

Uncertainty in the stability of PMMoV loading over time could lead to incorrect interpretations of contamination levels.
