## Description of the risk

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage indicates the presence of the virus and the potential for its spread in the population.

## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO_Scale/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Regular monitoring and testing of wastewater samples for sars-cov-2 can provide early detection and enable prompt control measures to prevent further spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_2162.md)

## Name of the risk

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can lead to further transmission of the virus and an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.
