# __Continuous monitoring of noise levels may be less valuable in comparison with other indoor environmental quality ieq parameters.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Geng_intelligent_2021](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_474.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Integrated monitoring systems to capture data on multiple ieq parameters including acoustic environment, prioritize research on the impact of acoustic environment on disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10821.md)

## Name of the risk

Potential neglect of acoustic environment in favor of other IEQ parameters, leading to suboptimal building conditions for disease control.
