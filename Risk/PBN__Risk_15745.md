# __Training on a large number of samples from the google open images dataset, including human body parts, increases the risk of model overfitting to specific characteristics of that dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Rezaei_deepsocial_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_593.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting, and augmentation of training data from diverse sources to improve model generalization.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_17686.md)

## Name of the risk

Poor generalization of the model to new data, leading to inaccurate or unreliable human detection in real-world scenarios.
