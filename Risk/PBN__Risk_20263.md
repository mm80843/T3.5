# __Relying solely on physical connections for spatial analysis may overlook other modes of disease transmission, such as airborne or surface-based transmission.__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Kembel_architectural_2014](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_687.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Incorporate additional metrics for disease transmission, such as air flow patterns and surface contact points, into spatial analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_22242.md)

## Name of the risk

Increases the risk of failing to identify potential disease transmission pathways, leading to ineffective mitigation strategies.
