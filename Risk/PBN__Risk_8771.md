# __Deriving ifr from assumptions about homogeneous attack rates across age-groups__

## Articles mentionning the risk

* [Flaxman_report_2020](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Article/PBN__Article_470.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Account for age-specific mixing patterns and adjust ifr estimates accordingly to reflect the actual distribution of infection and mortality across age-groups.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_10665.md)

## Name of the risk

Inaccurate estimation of infection-fatality-ratio (ifr) due to assumption of homogeneous attack rates across age-groups, leading to biased model outputs.
