# __Implementing Contagious Disease Control__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Standardizing coronavirus knowledge, the respiratory virus spreads through the built environment, work, touch, aerosols, and contaminated surfaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_73.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The context of this blueprint refers to managing and mitigating the risks associated with the transmission of airborne respiratory viruses such as the coronavirus in green buildings neighbourhoods. Green building strategies involve the use of technologies and practices that create environmentally friendly and resource-efficient buildings, but also provide an avenue for disease transmission if not properly managed. The blueprint addresses stakeholders including healthcare workers, the general public, building occupants, and homeowners, who are vulnerable to these risks.

* The risks targeted by this blueprint encompass a wide range of factors contributing to the spread and survival of airborne viruses in buildings. These include issues related to standardised knowledge about the coronavirus, the potential strain on healthcare services, the propagation of airborne viruses through inhalation of viral particles and physical contact, and virus longevity outside its host. Risks related to the built environment specifically highlight the role of high humidity and proximity among occupants as enhancers of viral transmission. The blueprint also highlights concerns over cleaning practices, viral shedding routes, viral survival in wastewater, and vertical transmission in high-rise establishments.

* Mitigation measures proposed in this blueprint are comprehensive and multi-pronged. Regulatory mechanisms are suggested to control temperature and humidity levels in the built environment, reducing viral survival and transmission. The use of touchless technologies, natural light incorporation, and self-cleaning spaces are suggested to limit physical contact and promote safer environments. Further measures incorporate proper ventilation and air filtration systems to manage air quality within the buildings. Stakeholders who are in a position to deploy these measures include building owners, facility managers, government entities, healthcare institutions, and cleaning personnel.

* Implementing these mitigation measures comes with several benefits. Primarily, it significantly reduces the risk of viral infections and transmission within the building environment, ensuring the health and safety of the occupants. It also results in improved asset value by ensuring buildings are equipped with the latest health and safety measures, technologies, and systems in place. Overall, this blueprint provides a comprehensive framework to manage and mitigate the risk of contagious disease transmission in green building neighbourhoods, ensuring a healthier and safer living environment.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The Blueprint proposes a comprehensive and proactive approach towards mitigating the transmission of contagious diseases, especially airborne viruses such as coronavirus, within green building neighbourhoods. It involves standardizing the awareness and knowledge about these viruses, implementing preventive measures such as controlling temperature and humidity levels within buildings, promoting the use of touchless technologies, and implementing proper air filtration systems. The blueprint also emphasizes natural rays of light in interiors and self-cleaning spaces to limit virus survival and transmission. Crucially, it encourages a reconsideration of cleaning practices and calls for measures against potential spread of viruses through less obvious means, such as wastewater and vertical shafts.

* Building owners, facility managers, healthcare institutions, government authorities, and cleaning staff can implement this blueprint.

* Building

* The blueprint encompasses a broad spectrum of risks, primarily tied to the transmission and survival of airborne respiratory viruses such as the coronavirus. Notably, it sheds light on the role high humidity and close-quarter contact can play in increasing virus transmission. It also addresses less obvious avenues of potential spread, such as improper cleaning practices and presence of viruses in wastewater. Ultimately, the blueprint underlines the need for a multidirectional approach to combat the spread of contagious diseases within built environments.
