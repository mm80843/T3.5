## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The Blueprint outlined addresses the pressing concern of spreading and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, particularly in green building neighborhoods. This virus is responsible for COVID-19, a pandemic that continues to challenge global health infrastructures. The Blueprint highlights several risks associated with the virus â€“ its transmission through various mediums, its longevity on surfaces, potential resistance development, and the difficulties posed in its removal from wastewater treatment facilities. The people most impacted by these risks span from healthcare professionals to the general public.

* The risks associated with the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic are cluttered and varied. The most notable is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which can occur in high-risk environments such as hospitals and poorly ventilated spaces, either through contaminated surfaces, direct contact, or aerosolized droplets. An equally critical concern is the persistence of the virus on surfaces, underlining the importance of effective and regular cleaning regimes. This is coupled with the risk of people developing resistances to anti-SARS-CoV-2 coatings. There remain major uncertainties over the origin of the virus and difficulties facing conventional wastewater treatment plants in effectively dealing with the virus.

* For the Blueprint to be effective in mitigating these risks, a series of measures have been suggested. Regular cleaning protocols and promoting hand hygiene are essential, as is the employment of protective barriers and personal protective equipment. Quarantine measures and social distancing initiatives play a critical role in curbing transmission. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) becomes vital in terms of monitoring prevalence and guiding the response. Practical elements of implementation include HVAC systems, signage, crowd control methods, and latency sampling in WBE for tracking COVID-19 prevalence.

* The implementation of the Blueprint offers a plethora of benefits, principal among these being the early detection of COVID-19 cases. The proposed measures account for population-wide surveillance, providing critical data to inform responses. Together, these elements form an effective early warning system for COVID-19 outbreaks, allowing for swift interventions to limit the scale of the impact. This, in turn, has the potential to significantly reduce the spread of the virus, ultimately safeguarding public health.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I recommend implementing the Blueprint, which provides a framework for mitigating the risks associated with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially in sustainable neighborhoods. The implementation process is straightforward and involves adopting hygiene protocols such as frequent cleaning and disinfection routines, enforcing use of personal protective equipment, and promoting good hand hygiene. In addition, physical measures such as floor markings for social distancing, employing HVAC systems for efficient indoor air circulation, and using air purifiers should be in place. Also, leveraging wastewater-based epidemiology for tracking COVID-19 prevalence is suggested.

* Stakeholders such as healthcare institutions, scientists, government bodies and health authorities can implement the Blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The Blueprint lists numerous risks including the transmission of the virus through the air, droplets, and physical contacts, its survival on diverse surfaces, unmanaged spread, and potential of resistance development towards anti-virus coatings. Furthermore, it outlines the challenges associated with removing the virus from wastewater treatment plants and existing uncertainties about the virus's origin.
