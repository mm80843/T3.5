# __Implementing Social Distancing and Surveillance__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The wide-ranging impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, from its spread in urban areas to its economic, social, and psychological consequences, call for urgent and effective crisis management.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_69.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for preventative and mitigation strategies to manage and reduce the spread of infectious diseases, especially in urban spaces, one of which is green buildings neighbourhoods. Given the virus's ability to circulate in enclosed spaces and affect a large number of individuals heightens the need for robust measures to counter this grave threat. This need forms the basis for our blueprint, specifically designed to address concerns tied to these built environments, incorporating spatial design, technology, and ongoing management practices to promote health and prevent disease transmission.

* Risks associated with the spread and impact of COVID-19 within or around green buildings neighbourhoods are multi-faceted, extending from transmission within public housing, streets, buildings to specific environments such as healthcare facilities and construction sites. Also, social, economic, and psychological risks like the amplification of existing inequalities, heightened fear and stigma, and mental health challenges cannot be overlooked. The lack of adequate preventive measures, non-compliance with solitude measures, and limited access to up-to-date information compound the risk profile, affecting sectors from construction to immigration. Misinformation, inadequate testing, and waste management, coupled with strained healthcare systems, complete the spectrum of threats that need to be managed.

* Mitigation measures proposed by this blueprint include clear social distancing protocols, travel restrictions, comprehensive wastewater surveillance, and in extreme conditions, implementation of total lockdowns. Some approaches may be simplistic like floor markings or physical barriers allowing for better flow management and distancing. Others involve advanced technological solutions, including the use of HVAC systems, air purifiers, wearable devices to enhance environmental safety, and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) to facilitate the efficient management of these measures. There is also a critical component of public awareness and educational campaigns to ensure understanding and cooperation from all stakeholders.

* The implementation of this blueprint comes with numerous benefits from reducing transmission, protecting society's most vulnerable, enhancing indoor air quality to improving property value. In doing so, it ensures the health and wellbeing of residents, visitors, and workers within these spaces, thereby fostering a safer and more resilient community in face of this and any future health crises. It's a way to balance disruption, health and economic factors in a delicate equation that ultimately favours safety, peace and continued vitality.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The 'Blueprint' is created to handle the risks related to the spread and impact of contagious diseases in green buildings neighbourhoods. The mitigation strategy revolves around controlling how people move, interact, and use shared space, particularly in densely populated areas. Implementation involves revising layouts using floor markings for effective social distancing, encouraging travel restrictions, and installing advanced technologies like HVAC systems and air purifiers for good air quality. Also, utilizing wearable devices for health monitoring and leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) for better space management is crucial. Moreover, making sure people are aware and educated about the necessary precautionary measures is an essential part of the blueprint.

* The blueprint can be implemented by multiple stakeholders including individuals, governments, healthcare organizations and institutions.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The risks covered in the blueprint primarily revolve around the extensive and complex issues of the spread and impact of contagious diseases. This includes risks not just directly related to pathogen transmission in public housing, streets, buildings and specific environments (like healthcare and construction), but also includes the broader impacts like exacerbating inequalities, instilling fear, stigma, and mental health challenges. The risks also highlight challenges due to lack of knowledge, reliable data, medication, and vaccines. The blueprint addresses these multifaceted risks with practical mitigation measures.
