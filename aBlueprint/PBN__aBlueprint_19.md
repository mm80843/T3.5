# __Implementing Disease Mitigation Strategies__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Urban areas suffer from a scarcity of accessible and diverse green spaces, contributing to disparities, inadequate quality, and decreased visitation, while also exacerbating health issues and environmental concerns.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_81.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The scope of this blueprint pertains to the management, accessibility, and risks associated with urban green spaces and infrastructure. With the increase in urbanization, green spaces have become a critical part of city planning, contributing to both the physical well-being of city dwellers and the ecological balance of the urban environment. However, the existence and efficacy of these spaces are strained by various factors, further magnified during the recent Covid-19 pandemic. 

* The blueprint identifies a variety of risks challenging the establishment and maintenance of green urban spaces. These risks range from the loss of urban biodiversity and substandard distribution of green spaces to its diminished appeal during the pandemic. High installation and maintenance costs of green roofs further deter their proliferation within residential sectors. Public parks' reliance on government intervention, and exceedingly low visits only highlight the issue further. The risks also highlight how disadvantaged communities are affected due to the poor quality of green spaces available to them.

* To mitigate such risks, the blueprint suggests incentives for green roofs installation and developing cost-effective maintenance strategies. Raising public awareness about green roof benefits through education and outreach programs, and advancing research can help rectify the situation. Incorporating green spaces in healthcare facilities and creating healing gardens can also improve their overall appeal and utility. To address gender-based disparities, gender-specific research on green space benefits can be beneficial in strategizing targeted interventions. 

* The blueprint's benefits are manifold. The provisioning of urban green spaces significantly improves mental health, contributes to overall health benefits, and supports wildlife living within the urban perimeter. The implementation of this blueprint would lead to an equitable distribution of green spaces, increased public awareness about their importance, conservation of urban biodiversity, and a more inclusive urban environment for all residents. It ultimately aspires to create sustainable, livable, and healthy urban spaces.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* The blueprint, in essence, aims to enhance urban green spaces to mitigate potential contagious disease risks, improve health, and sustain urban ecosystems. Implementing it involves strategies such as promoting indoor gardening, integrating green spaces into healthcare facilities, and increasing awareness about the advantages of green roofs. It also necessitates the provision of financial incentives for the installation of green roofs and development of cost-effective maintenance plans. Gender-specific research on the benefits of green spaces to devise targeted interventions is an important part of this plan. 

* The blueprint can be implemented by a range of stakeholders including urban planners, developers, city governments, community organizations, and local governments.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The blueprint identifies a variety of risks related to urban green spaces, including loss of biodiversity, reduced access during lockdowns, and higher installation and maintenance costs. It also highlights the perceived risks of accessing these spaces amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, inequality in distribution, and less visitation. It underscores the need for improved management of such spaces, boosting public awareness and understanding of their benefits, and promoting initiatives like the European Green Deal.
