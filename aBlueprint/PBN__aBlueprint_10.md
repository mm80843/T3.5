# __Implementing Contagious Disease Control: Stakeholders, Strategies, and Technologies__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [Rapid transmission and global impact of infectious diseases, including those spread by vectors, due to various factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_65.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The Blueprint detailed herein provides a strategic and targeted approach towards addressing risks associated with contagious diseases within the unique context of green building neighbourhoods. Given the inherently communal way of living in such residential areas, the transmission of diseases may potentially be higher, especially where population densities and frequent human interaction are a given. Risks can further increase due to factors such as inadequate knowledge about disease transmission, delayed disease reporting, airborne transmission, climate-associated diseases and the threats posed by pests such as mosquitoes and ticks.

* The risks needing mitigation within this blueprint are multifaceted. They range from the direct physical threat of vector-borne and airborne diseases to the more abstract risks associated with a lack of disease understanding and knowledge. Important considerations include the quick pace at which diseases may spread amongst a closely-knit community, the emergence of new disease strains, and the tardy reporting of infectious diseases â€“ all of which could extend the reach of an outbreak. Other risks tied to the increased prevalence and importation of diseases have also been flagged, as have concerns about the vulnerability of specific groups, such as healthcare workers, to infection.

* Mitigation measures within this blueprint focus heavily on enforcing and ensuring the practice of social distancing protocols within such neighbourhoods. Through careful implementation of measures such as wastewater-based epidemiology, extensive vaccination drives, quarantine rules, and internal travel constraints, it is envisaged that the risk of disease spread could be substantially diminished. In addition, the integration of various technologies such as IoT, physical distance monitoring systems, and technology-enabled measures are proposed to strengthen mitigation efforts. These proposed measures also involve stakeholders like the government, building owners, healthcare institutions and organizations, building managers, and many more.

* The benefits of implementing this blueprint are compelling. The mitigation measures have not only the potential to substantially reduce the risk of infection and transmission but also to increase the asset value of green buildings neighbourhoods. As such, this blueprint offers a more substantial, structured, and concerted response to the risks posed by contagious diseases, simultaneously laying the groundwork for healthier, safer, and more prosperous communities.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I highly recommend implementing the 'Blueprint' in practice for safer green building neighborhoods. The blueprint presents a strategic approach to mitigate the danger of contagious diseases. The measures outlined include practicing social distancing, leveraging wastewater-based epidemiology, encouraging mass vaccination, enforcing quarantine guidelines for those affected, and imposing internal travel constraints. Furthermore, it relies on technological advancements such as IoT, physical space monitoring systems, wearable devices, and the internet for effective implementation. Simply put, it's a comprehensive guide, leveraging technology, established health practices, and vigilant monitoring to ensure safety in high-density residential areas.

* Stakeholders including government authorities, building owners, healthcare institutions, health organizations, and building managers can implement the blueprint.

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The 'Blueprint' aims at mitigating several risks. These include the potential rapid spread of diseases, the susceptibility to vector-borne diseases, lack of awareness about disease prevention, delayed disease reporting, airborne transmission, and the possible introduction of new disease strains. It further covers risks peculiar to high-density areas such as increased prevalence of respiratory diseases, climate-associated diseases and gnawing damage that contributes to disease spread.
