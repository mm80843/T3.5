# __Implementing Strategic Measures to Counteract Contagious Diseases__

## 0. Blueprints points to this category of risks

* [The pandemic has led to a decrease in in-person surgical education, loss of control, temporary panic from cruise ship docking, limited social distancing, and decreased morale.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_70.md)

## 1. Summary of the blueprint

* The blueprint in discussion addresses the complex and far-reaching risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases within infrastructure, particularly in green building neighbourhoods. Green buildings, designed for environmental and human health benefits, are increasingly becoming the norm in urban environments. Their unique characteristics, such as shared amenities and populated common spaces, present specific challenges during a contagious disease outbreak. The purpose of this blueprint is to provide a sophisticated and thorough mitigation strategy against these risks.

* Contagious disease outbreaks in green building neighbourhoods risk affecting a multitude of areas including educational activities, physical and mental health, social interaction, and supply chains, making the situation critically complex. Besides the health impacts, the threat also trickles down to unanticipated areas such as increased noise disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, reduction in public gatherings, disruption in material supply and resistance to change. Certain populations such as children, students, and the young are specifically vulnerable. Overall, these risks negatively impact the morale, productivity and social stability of individuals living in these green building neighbourhoods.

* The blueprint proposes varied mitigation measures to tackle the variety of risks. Key measures include promoting awareness and education about preventive measures, enforcing guidelines for responsible behaviour and adherence to protocols, diversifying suppliers to reduce dependence on key suppliers, and implementing distance learning solutions. Other strategies include mandating strict compliance to mask-wearing at construction sites, providing technology and internet access for students to facilitate distance learning, and utilizing technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, and internet-based communication to monitor and manage disease spread.

* Implementing this mitigation blueprint offers several significant benefits. Firstly, it reduces disease transmission within green building communities, crucially protecting the health and wellbeing of residents. Secondly, it improves communication methods and access to education for students, minimising disruption in learning. Lastly, it reduces potential financial losses caused by disruptions in productivity within these neighbourhoods. The combined efforts and measures through this blueprint ultimately contribute to a safer and more protected community during outbreaks of contagious diseases.

## 2. Details of the blueprint

* I highly recommend implementing the blueprint for mitigating the risks associated with the spread of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. The blueprint offers a comprehensive list of risk descriptions, mitigating measures, and tools to address them, aiming to educate and enforce responsible behavior, diversify suppliers, mandate mask-wearing in construction sites, and facilitate distance learning among other measures. The blueprint outlines technology-enabled measures involving the Internet of Things, public awareness campaigns, and physical barriers like floor markings, catering to a variety of individuals within these neighborhoods, be it students, young individuals or the general public. The benefits derived from implementing this blueprint include improved communication, reduced disease transmission, and financial losses, contributing to both the health and well-being and the economic stability of the community. 

* The stakeholders who can implement the blueprint include government institutions, public health agencies, NGOs, educators, and schools. 

* 'Neighbourhood'

* The blueprint identifies a range of risks associated with contagious disease outbreaks in green building neighbourhoods. These include disruptions in education and public activities, negative impacts on physical and mental health due to quarantine and social isolation, decreased morale and productivity, panic and fear, restriction of movement, material supply disruptions, and resistance to preventive measures among others. The risks highlighted encompass a wide array of issues, underlining the complexity of challenges faced during such outbreaks in densely populated, shared-space environments like green-building neighbourhoods.
