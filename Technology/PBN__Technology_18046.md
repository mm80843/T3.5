# __Regularization techniques__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Risk of overfitting in the neural network](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15745.md)
* [Training on a large number of samples from the google open images dataset, including human body parts, increases the risk of model overfitting to specific characteristics of that dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15771.md)
* [Use of data augmentation techniques such as mosaic may create a false sense of data variety and lead to overfitting if not used carefully](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16075.md)
