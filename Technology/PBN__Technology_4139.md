# __Advanced statistical modeling__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Detrending the time series data to account for the long-term trend in strava data may oversimplify the analysis and mask important variations in activity patterns.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_3568.md)
* [Exclusion of an indicator with high skewness and kurtosis from further statistical analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5688.md)
* [Inconsistencies in the impact of rh, temperature, and ah on virus survival may lead to misinterpretation of risk factors.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5886.md)
* [No significance was found in the effect of age and gender on droplet generation, potentially leading to underestimation of transmission risk in different demographic groups.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7323.md)
* [Reduced variance in the aggregated data may prevent identification of statistically significant effects](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8822.md)
* [Statistical noise in individual policy effects may lead to uncertainty in their impact on reducing infection rates.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9889.md)
* [Statistically nonsignificant results for certain health outcomes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12311.md)
* [Unobserved factors such as environmental elements, weather, and attitudinal predispositions may impact the prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_12890.md)
* [Use of linear mixed effects model may not accurately represent the complexity of disease transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18690.md)
