## Risks linked to this technology

* [Difficulty in establishing a simple relationship between air change rate increases and the width of opening of a single window.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5441.md)
* [Effect of wind speed and occupancy on air change rates in homes.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9846.md)
* [Inadequate air mixing in rooms with a mixing ventilation system may result in atypical distribution of micro-organisms, increasing infection risk.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9858.md)
* [The assumption that the room air is well mixed may not hold true in all situations, leading to inaccurate calculations of average particle residence time and irradiation flux.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10501.md)
