## Risks linked to this technology

* [Air recirculation can transport infectious contaminants through spaces, leading to the re-entry of virus particles into workstations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7792.md)
* [Failure to close recirculation dampers can lead to the distribution of airborne contaminants from one point to others connected to the same system.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7793.md)
* [Insufficient outdoor airflow can contribute to the buildup of infectious contaminants in indoor spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7794.md)
* [Use of induction units and fan coils with local circulation may lead to the resuspension of virus particles.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7795.md)
