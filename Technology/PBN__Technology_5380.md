# __Biophilic design principles__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Inadequate housing design and planning contributing to poor living conditions and increased disease susceptibility.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4435.md)
* [Inherent tension between mechanistic, reductive scientific paradigms in green building design and emerging regenerative development approaches may impact the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies in built environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5552.md)
* [Lack of connection to nature, daylight, and fresh air in housing and residential areas](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7269.md)
* [Lack of consideration for pandemic-resilient design elements in residential buildings](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8253.md)
* [Lack of consideration for social and physical interactions among occupants and the built environment](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10353.md)
* [Lack of consideration for virus spread in home environments](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10363.md)
* [Lack of green spaces and natural elements in buildings](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18966.md)
* [Lack of natural elements and outdoor exposure may impact mental health and immune function.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_18984.md)
* [The emotional need for ’nature’ is explained as an inherited affection from the experience of choosing habitats and building dwellings, which can lead to a preference for natural characteristics in modern architectural spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_19485.md)
