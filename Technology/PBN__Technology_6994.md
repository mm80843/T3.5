# __Directional airflow control__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Displacement ventilation performs worse when patients are lying sideways, leading to the persistence of exhalation jets over a long distance.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5728.md)
* [Hospital-acquired infections due to airborne chemical and microbiological pollutants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5729.md)
* [Increasing the throw of the supply jet from the floor diffuser can deteriorate inhaled air quality and promote resuspension of particles including those carrying respiratory pathogens.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5730.md)
* [Poor indoor air quality leading to occupational diseases among health care workers](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8368.md)
* [The proximity of people in densely occupied spaces increases the risk of disease transmission by contact and droplet transmission despite the use of dilution ventilation.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8369.md)
