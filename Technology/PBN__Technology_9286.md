# __Wastewater-based epidemiology wbe__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Delay in u.s. federal agencies’ interest in wbe for covid-19 tracking](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_1434.md)
* [Detection of sars-cov-2 in wastewater](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7684.md)
* [Global monitoring of 2.1 billion people in sewage treatment plants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7688.md)
* [High cost of individual clinical testing for large populations may limit the frequency and scope of testing, leading to delayed or incomplete identification of infected individuals.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7689.md)
* [Inadequate testing capacity for a nation’s population may lead to slow and incomplete assessment of infection status, allowing for undetected spread of contagious diseases.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7693.md)
* [Lack of effective surveillance systems for infectious disease outbreaks](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7736.md)
* [Lack of interest from state and federal governments in the u.s.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7737.md)
* [Limited clinical testing capacity compared to population size may result in slow and costly screening processes, hindering effective assessment and management of contagious disease spread.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7738.md)
* [Limited national reception of wbe in the u.s. for covid-19 tracking](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9395.md)
* [Potential for significant forward transmission of contagious diseases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9414.md)
* [Potential for undetected outbreaks in confined subpopulations like schools, hospitals, and warehouses.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9420.md)
* [Potential transmission of sars-cov-2 via feces in wastewater](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9421.md)
* [Sars-cov-2 rna detected in untreated wastewater samples](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9422.md)
* [Underestimation of covid-19 prevalence due to seasonal temperature changes and wastewater temperatures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_11825.md)
* [Variability in the timing of shedding sars-cov-2 into stool and persistence of shedding after symptoms resolve poses challenges for wbe.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_14240.md)
* [Wbe may detect covid-19 before it is possible with random diagnostic testing, but the timing of virus shedding is uncertain.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_16056.md)
