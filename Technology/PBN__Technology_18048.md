# __And transfer learning from diverse datasets to improve model generalization__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Training on a large number of samples from the google open images dataset, including human body parts, increases the risk of model overfitting to specific characteristics of that dataset and may not generalize well to other datasets.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15745.md)
