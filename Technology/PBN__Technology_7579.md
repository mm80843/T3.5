# __Iot-based monitoring systems__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Inadequate indoor air quality assessment leading to potential health risks from indoor pollutants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6228.md)
* [Increased exposure to indoor air pollutants in village areas due to the use of solid fuels, leading to higher risk of respiratory diseases and infections.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6229.md)
* [Indoor environment quality ieq monitoring systems are necessary to detect energy-waste situations and contribute to developing solutions. since this is a worldwide problem, it is important to achieve versatile and low-cost ieq monitoring systems that are easy to implant in different buildings.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6230.md)
* [Lack of emphasis on designing suitable iaq management systems for village areas may lead to neglecting the health of rural populations and hindering overall medical health improvement efforts.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_8912.md)
* [The problem of energy waste, typically found in offices and public buildings, was presented to the students of the b.sc. degree in industrial electronics and automation engineering for raising awareness about the sdgs and encouraging sustainability.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15255.md)
* [The work describes a full iot scalable architecture aimed at monitoring indoor environmental quality inside public buildings, such as university faculties, which runs over existing communication infrastructures.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15256.md)
* [Traditional ieq monitoring protocol involving high-cost, invasive environmental sensors with limited spatial dimension and data storage.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_15288.md)
