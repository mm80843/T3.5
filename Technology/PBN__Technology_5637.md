## Risks linked to this technology

* [Few risk calculators account for all three routes of transmission: fomite, airborne, and droplets, potentially underestimating the virus exposure dose for occupants.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4643.md)
* [Graphene derivatives with larger lateral size have stronger adsorption ability, which affects the physicochemical interaction with microorganisms.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5003.md)
* [High exposure risks in construction activities](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10465.md)
* [Ineffective building measures for virus mitigation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_10530.md)
