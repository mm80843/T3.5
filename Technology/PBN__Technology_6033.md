# __Portable air purifiers__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Inadequate ventilation on small balconies may limit air circulation and increase the risk of airborne disease transmission.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_4974.md)
* [Insufficient measures to reduce respiratory aerosol transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6149.md)
* [Limitations in increasing ventilation rates during the covid-19 pandemic](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_6219.md)
* [Not all air-handling systems have capacity to substantially increase outside air ratios](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_7843.md)
* [The settling time of small aerosols being comparable to ventilation timescales, leading to prolonged exposure to aerosols in indoor spaces.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9537.md)
* [Unlikely radical changes to interior environments over the short term due to heavy regulation and contextual value-laden rules.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_17851.md)
