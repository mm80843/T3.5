# __Advanced rna detection methods like crispr and dpcr__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Lack of optimization for the entire protocol from sampling to detection/quantification may lead to inaccurate results and inefficient virus analysis.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5201.md)
* [Significant issues identified for the virus quantitative analysis in wastewater and sludge matrices, indicating potential challenges in accurate virus detection and quantification in these complex environments.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5202.md)
* [Utilization of advanced rna detection methods like crispr and dpcr for virus detection and quantification presents the risk of misinterpretation or inadequate understanding of the results compared to traditional methods like rt-qpcr.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_5203.md)
