# __Wastewater-based epidemiology wbe studies with temperature adjustment mechanisms__

## Risks linked to this technology

* [Neglecting the impact of temperature on degradation of biomarkers in wastewater can lead to error propagation into estimates of upstream discharge, consumption, exposure, and excretion.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9410.md)
* [Wastewater-based epidemiology wbe studies that do not adjust monitoring results to temperature risk significant under- or over-estimation of the true temporal changes occurring in virus shedding within the community.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Risk/PBN__Risk_9411.md)
