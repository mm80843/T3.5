The samples were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect specific genes of the virus, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences of other coronaviruses. The study found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the untreated wastewater samples, indicating the presence of the virus in the population. The RT-qPCR analysis also showed differences in the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material between the solid and liquid phases of the wastewater samples. While the viral RNA was detected in the solid phase, its concentration was higher in the liquid phase, possibly due to the repartitioning of genetic material during wastewater treatment. The study also found that the detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the wastewater samples was non-infectious based on tests conducted on cultured cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of wastewater-based monitoring as a tool to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population.']\n",

The National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) and the National Immigration Agency integrated patients' travel history with their NHI identification card data, allowing the government to track individuals at high risk. Those identified as high risk were monitored electronically through their mobile phones. The government also established the National Health Command Center (NHCC) as the operational command point for direct communications among central, regional, and local authorities. Taiwan has rapidly implemented over 120 action items, including border control, case identification, quarantine measures, resource allocation, and public education. The government has communicated with the public in a clear and compassionate manner, with high approval ratings for their handling of the crisis. Challenges faced include language barriers for non-Taiwanese citizens and the docking of a cruise ship with confirmed infections.
