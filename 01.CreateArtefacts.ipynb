Blueprints points to this category of risks\\n\\n* [The hidden and unnoticed occurrence of covid-19 instances contributes to the silent spread of the virus.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/PBNCategory/PBN__PBNCategory_99.md)\\n\\n## 1. Summary of the blueprint\\n\\n* The Blueprint is designed to address the risks and challenges associated with the spread and management of contagious diseases specifically within green building neighbourhoods - a growing trend that aims to host a healthy living and working environment. In these neighbourhoods, the impact of such diseases could be amplified due to factors like interconnectedness and visibility. Furthermore, in the light of increasing globalization and travel, the risk of importation and introduction of new cases leaves these communities particularly vulnerable. \\n\\n* The risks in these neighbourhoods primarily revolve around a domino effect of disruptions that one incident can trigger, coupled with difficulties in timely identification of cases, and the high number of undetected cases, including asymptomatic ones, which poses challenges for surveillance and containment efforts. In addition, there is a lack of sufficient monitoring of asymptomatic and unreported cases, perpetuating the spread of the disease. Under-reporting of cases and instances of reinfections further compounds the problem, intensifying concerns about the duration and effectiveness of immunity.\\n\\n* The Blueprint leverages varied mitigation measures to counter the contagion. These include the implementation of comprehensive testing and reporting strategies, strengthening of surveillance systems to detect and treat asymptomatic cases, an augmentation of testing capacities, and resorting to alternative surveillance methods. To ensure system resilience, there is a need to diversify dependencies and establish robust backup systems, identifying dependencies and inter-dependencies.\\n\\n* The benefits of implementing this mitigation Blueprint are significant. These include a reduction in importation of cases consequently leading to reduced disease spread. It enables the creation of a robust frontline defence in green building neighbourhoods against the spread of contagious diseases to make these sustainable communities resilient. This not only aids in the creation of a healthy living environment but also serves as an example of proactive preparedness and response to infectious diseases.\\n\\n## 2. Details of the blueprint\\n\\n* The Blueprint is a strategic toolkit designed as an effective defense against the propagation of contagious diseases in green building neighborhoods. The implementation of the Blueprint involves enhancing thorough testing and reporting systems, fortifying active surveillance mechanisms for asymptomatic cases, extending testing capacities, and developing unconventional surveillance methods. Essentially, the goal is to augment system resilience, diversify dependencies, and construct comprehensive backup systems. This approach, coupled with efficient communication channels between healthcare providers and public health authorities, can contribute significantly to containing disease spread in such settings.\\n \\n* The main entities empowered to implement this Blueprint are Healthcare organizations, Critical infrastructure operators, Businesses, Public health authorities, and Government agencies.\\n\\n* 'Neighbourhood'\\n\\n* The risks outlined in the Blueprint primarily pertain to the heightened potential for disease spread in interconnected communities like green building neighbourhoods. These risks include cascading disruptions where one incident sets off a chain of further disruptions, challenges in timely case identification and handling, and the reality of a significant number of undetected cases, including asymptomatic ones. The latter contributes to insufficient surveillance and containment efforts, under-recording of cases, and uncertainties regarding the duration and effectiveness of immunity after infection and recovery.\\n\\n## 3.
