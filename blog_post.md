In a recent development in the Horizon 2020 PROBONO project, a feasibility experiment titled "Creating Knowledge Graphs from the Literature: The Case of Health Resilience in Green Building Neighbourhoods" has been undertaken to see how literature review could be automated so to produce content leverage Green Building Neighbourhoods (GBNs) for enhancing community health resilience. The initiative focuses on harnessing technological and social innovations within GBNs to improve sustainability and societal benefits through digitization and smart technologies. The task specifically reviews interventions for mitigating disease outbreaks, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) among other technologies to develop a knowledge graph that consolidates a vast array of literature on the subject. This innovative approach not only demonstrates the potential for building extensive domain-specific knowledge bases but also paves the way for further exploration in the intersection between LLMs and knowledge graphs.

The technical process involved in creating the knowledge graph is intricate, relying on a variety of tools to parse, structure, and process information from scientific literature. Tools like GROBID, Owlready2, and vector databases were used for initial data preparation, while natural language processing (backed by tools like NLTK, Spacy) and LLMs API (including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) facilitated the extraction of themes, entity recognition, and text processing.  This methodical approach enabled the structuring of data into a knowledge graph, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of key risks, stakeholders, technologies, and mitigation measures at both building and neighbourhood scales. The application of such a diverse toolkit underscores the complexity and depth of analysis required to effectively consolidate and utilize knowledge from existing literature.

The project's outcomes are promising, with the knowledge graph encompassing a vast array of articles, risks, mitigation measures, stakeholders, and technologies related to disease outbreak mitigation in GBNs. The creation of 'Blueprints' for possible interventions highlights the practical application of the knowledge graph. 

Envisaging to release the knowledge graph available under an Creative Commons license, the project invites researchers, health professionals and other stakeholders to engage with and expand upon this resource. The planned future steps include integrating more robust graph management solutions and enriching the semantic content of the graph, indicating a commitment to evolving the knowledge base to better serve public health strategies. This work, while a research-based exploration, might offer valuable systemic insights and a framework for further dialogue and action in public health and sustainability realms for Green Building Neighbourhoods.
