## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_2__ (Cluster_2)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Monitoring of wastewater

### Idea description

One year ago, the European Commission has already recommended EU Member States to put in place wastewater monitoring program to track COVID-19 and its variants. As a result, today around 1 370 EU wastewater treatment plant are under regular surveillance. This blueprint aims to transfer this practise to the neighbourhood level. It is demonstrated that monitoring wastewater effluents is a robust source of information to mitigate the spread of virus. Under this context, the following blueprint proposes to equip relevant wastewater effluents with digital tools and sensors to collect real-time data about pathogens concentrations for guideline and policy-making purposes.

### Why?

Past experience with other viral diseases, such as polio, hepatitis A and norovirus, has shown that effluent-based epidemiology is an effective tool to detect the presence of pathogens and provide a clear indication of increasing or decreasing transmission. In addition, continuous monitoring of wastewater enables early detection of viral mutations/variants that allow precautionary measures to be taken. On the other hand, the good correlation between the number of COVID -19 cases and the concentration of pathogens measured in some EU wastewater treatment plants shows that this approach is effective in controlling the development of pandemics.

### Contextual situations

This measure is effective as long as the residential neighbourhood is operational. 
In addition, the more people live in the neighbourhood, the more representative the data will be.

### Problems to solve

The water in the sewage system serves as an early warning system for the outbreak of a disease in the urban population. This means that contaminated sewage also serves as a medium for the spread of disease 
Surveillance and monitoring of pathogens in wastewater complements current infectious disease surveillance systems and serves as an early warning system for disease outbreaks.

### Value proposition

In general terms, this blueprint provides a cheap, rapid and robust tool of tracking diseases. The ability of this measure to rapidly monitor the spread of disease is key for prevention, intervention and control.

### Capabilities

For this measure to be effective, it is of utmost importance to select a broad panel of markers that provide information on (i) pathogenic organisms (bacteria and viruses), (ii) biochemical markers associated with physiological responses, (iii) markers for intervention (drugs) and (iv) markers for antimicrobial resistance.

### Restrictions and limitations

Although no data is collected on specific individuals, several ethical aspects of this measure can be discussed. It is generally accepted that a population size of more than > 10,000 is sufficient to ensure anonymity and not pose a risk. This number is far from the number of people who might live in a neighbourhood. As a result, some people might be stigmatised by the measure. On the other hand, a smaller number of people may also have an impact on the sensitivity of the system (lower concentrations of pathogens).
