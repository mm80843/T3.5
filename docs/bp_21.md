## Description

### Blueprint title

Monitoring of wastewater [CID]

### Idea description

One year ago, the European Commission has already recommended EU Member States to put in place wastewater monitoring program to track COVID-19 and its variants. As a result, today around 1 370 EU wastewater treatment plant are under regular surveillance. This blueprint aims to transfer this practise to the neighbourhood level. It is demonstrated that monitoring wastewater effluents is a robust source of information to mitigate the spread of virus. Under this context, the following blueprint proposes to equip relevant wastewater effluents with digital tools and sensors to collect real-time data about pathogens concentrations for guideline and policy-making purposes.

### Why?

The experience from other viral diseases in the past, such as polio, hepatitis A and norovirus, has shown that wastewater-based epidemiology is an effective tool to detect the presence of pathogens and provide a strong indication of increasing or decreasing transmission. Moreover, continuous monitoring of wastewater provides the early detection of virus mutations/variants that helps to take precautions. On the other hand, the good correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and pathogens concentration measured in some EU wastewater treatment plants demonstrates that this blueprint is effective on controlling the evolution of pandemics.

### Contextual situations

This measure is effective as long as the residential neighbourhood is operational. 
In addition, the more people live in the neighbourhood, the more representative the data will be.

### Problems to solve

Water in the sewer system acts as early warning to the outbreak of a disease in the urban population. That means that contaminated wastewater also acts as a medium for the spread of disease. 
Surveillance and monitoring of the pathogens in the wastewater complement the current infectious disease surveillance systems and act as an early warning system for disease outbreaks.

### Value proposition

In general terms, this blueprint provides a cheap, rapid and robust tool of tracking diseases. The ability of this measure to rapidly monitor the spread of disease is key for prevention, intervention and control.

### Capabilities

For this measure to be effective, it is of paramount importance to choose a wide-ranging panel of markers providing information on (i) pathogenic organisms (bacteria and viruses), (ii) biochemical markers linked with physiological response, (iii) markers of intervention (pharmaceuticals) and (iv) markers of antimicrobial resistance.

### Restrictions and limitations

Although, data are not collected on specific individuals, several ethical aspects of this measure can be discussed. It is generally accepted that populations over > 10,000 is enough to give anonymity and will pose no risk. This number is quite far from the number of people who might live in a neighbourhood. As a result, some people may be stigmatised as a result of the measure. On the other hand, a reduced number of people can also affect to the sensitivity of the system (lower concentrations of pathogens).
