## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_10__ (Cluster_10)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Rotational Shift System

### Idea description

During the outbreak of COVID-19 large organizations as well as numerous educational institutions have explored the potential of lowering disease transmission by dividing their personnel (and pupils) into smaller groups, taking turns in using and operating the physical space in confined and high-occupancy areas. The main idea is to establish a rotational shift schedule in areas where there is high occupancy with the main focus on managing the staff presence through shifts rather than the potential users of the services provided.

### Why?

Limitation of the occupancy of confined areas allows for better social distancing and control over indoor parameters (such as the concentration of CO2 in the air). Moreover, rotation of the workforce prevents transmission of the disease between the majority of the employees and therefore the preservation of the final quality of the service and brings greater flexibility to the customers.

### Contextual situations

This measure is to be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or large retail businesses during morning and evening peak hours and weekends. To be functional, this measure envisages greater flexibility of the main stakeholders – workers, who should be willing to accept the limitation of their access.

### Problems to solve

Smaller possibility of disease transmission due to the less over-crowded areas and interruptions of services due to an unavailable workforce.

### Value proposition

Implementing this measure will make the control over occupancy and critical indoor parameters possible while maintaining the quality of services and productivity at usual levels as well as providing flexibility to the end users of those services.

### Capabilities

Well-functioning of the Rotational Shift System lays on three main pillars – 1) a shift booking system for division of workforce into specific groups depending on the situation 2) enlightenment of the users through information campaigns about the logic behind this measure 3) a robust testing plan for a quick reaction time in case of infection in one of the groups

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this specific measure:
- Users  (staff mostly)' non-acceptance
- Behavioural change
- Risk of having to duplicate resources: business inefficiency might entail higher costs to final users to mitigate financial impact.
- Need for greater planning including testing of users
- Misinformation
- Slow reaction time
- Number of users
