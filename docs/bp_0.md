## Description

### Blueprint title

Rotational Shift System

### Idea description

During the COVID -19 outbreak, large organisations, as well as many educational institutions, explored the potential to reduce disease transmission by dividing their staff (and students) into smaller groups that take turns using and servicing physical space in enclosed and high-traffic areas. The main idea is to introduce a rotating shift schedule in high occupancy areas, focusing on managing staff presence through shifts rather than the potential users of the services provided.

### Why?

Limiting the occupancy of enclosed spaces allows for better social distancing and control over indoor parameters (such as CO2 concentration in the air). In addition, rotating the workforce prevents the transmission of diseases between the majority of staff, thus maintaining the final quality of service and bringing more flexibility to clients.

### Contextual situations

This measure should be used in enclosed and busy areas such as offices (during working hours) or large retail outlets during morning and evening rush hours and at weekends. For this measure to work, greater flexibility is envisaged on the part of the main actors - the workers - who should be willing to accept the restriction of their access.

### Problems to solve

Smaller possibility of disease transmission due to the less over-crowded areas and interruptions of services due to an unavailable workforce.

### Value proposition

The implementation of this measure will allow control over occupancy and critical parameters in the indoor spaces, while maintaining the quality of services and productivity at the usual level and providing flexibility to the end users of these services.

### Capabilities

Well-functioning of the Rotational Shift System lays on three main pillars – 1) a shift booking system for division of workforce into specific groups depending on the situation 2) enlightenment of the users through information campaigns about the logic behind this measure 3) a robust testing plan for a quick reaction time in case of infection in one of the groups

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this specific measure:
- Users  (staff mostly)' non-acceptance
- Behavioural change
- Risk of having to duplicate resources: business inefficiency might entail higher costs to final users to mitigate financial impact.
- Need for greater planning including testing of users
- Misinformation
- Slow reaction time
- Number of users
