## Abstract

Abstract The disinfection of high-contact surfaces is seen
as an infection control practice to prevent the spread of
pathogens by fomites. Unfortunately, recontamination of
these surfaces can occur any time after the use of common
disinfectants. We recently reported on a novel continuously
active antimicrobial coating which was shown to reduce the
spread of healthcare acquired infections in hospitals. We
evaluated a modified coating that demonstrated a residual
efficacy against viruses. The coated surfaces were found to
be effective against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E,
reducing the concentration of these viruses by greater than
90\% in 10 minutes and by greater than 99.9\% after two
hours of contact. The coating formulation when tested in
suspension yielded a greater than 99.99\% reduction of HCoV
229E within ten minutes of contact. This outcome presents
an opportunity for controlling the transmission of COVID-19
from contaminated fomites.
