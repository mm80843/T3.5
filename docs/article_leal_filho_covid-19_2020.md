## Abstract

COVID-19, as a pandemic, is impacting institutions around
the world. Its scope and economic dimensions also mean that
it poses a major threat towards achieving the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article
discusses how the coronavirus pandemic may influence the
SDGs and could affect their implementation. The methods
used entail an analysis of the literature, observations and
an assessment of current world trends. The results obtained
point out that, while COVID-19 has become a priority to
many health systems in developing nations, they still need
to attend to many other existing diseases such as malaria,
yellow fever and others. Further, the study shows that
strong concerns in dealing with COVID-19 are disrupting
other disease prevention programs. As a result, problems
such as mental health are also likely to be overlooked,
since the isolation of social distancing may mask or lead
to an increase in the percentage of suffers. The paper
suggests that, due to its wide scope and areas of
influence, COVID-19 may also jeopardize the process of the
implementation of the SDGs. It sends a cautious warning
about the need to continue to put an emphasis on the
implementation of the SDGs, so that the progress achieved
to date is not endangered.
