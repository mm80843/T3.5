## Abstract

COVID-19 pandemic caused a massive impact on healthcare,
social life, and economies on a global scale. Apparently,
technology has a vital role to enable ubiquitous and
accessible digital health services in pandemic conditions
as well as against “re-emergence” of COVID-19 disease
in a post-pandemic era. Accordingly, 5G systems and
5G-enabled e-health solutions are paramount. This paper
highlights methodologies to effectively utilize 5G for
e-health use cases and its role to enable relevant digital
services. It also provides a comprehensive discussion of
the implementation issues, possible remedies and future
research directions for 5G to alleviate the health
challenges related to COVID-19.
