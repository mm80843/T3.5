## Description

### Blueprint title

Mental health – Act: Do something

### Idea description

Act, Belong and Commit, describes the behaviours that contribute to positive mental health. This blueprints aims at the first driver; Act. This focuses on keeping physically, mentally, spiritually and socially active: So on “doing something’. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022) (Meilstrup, et al. 2022). A GBN could approach positive mental health through Acting or “doing something” by working with implementing measures that increases the opportunities for: 
Physical activity: It could for instance be measures increasing possibilities of ball gaming such as football or basketball, swimming, dancing, or gardening in the GBN. 
Social activity: Measures focusing on social activities in the GBN. This could be activities such as different social clubs, outside choir or social activities for colleagues, students etc. 
Mental activity: Keeping mental active is about doing something that requires concentration, such as reading a book, playing a game, going to the cinema or looking at art. A GBN could apply measures including these as accessible activities. 
Spiritual activity: This is generally about calmness and immersion. It could for instance be measures increasing possibilities in the GBN for a quiet walks in a park, doing yoga or tai-chi, religious services etc

### Why?

Anxiety, worry and stress are normal reactions to perceived or real threats and to times when we face uncertainty. It is normal and understandable for people to feel fear in the context of the pandemic COVID -19. Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic like COVID -19 are the significant changes in our daily lives as our freedom of movement is restricted to contain and slow the spread of the virus. With new realities such as working from home, temporary unemployment, home schooling for the children and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we take care not only of our physical health but also our mental health. ((WHO) 2022)

### Contextual situations

An important element to include when working with the different measures is the ability for the measures or activities to adapt to changing public restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distances or prohibition of gathering. So assuring that the activities can continue in other formats during a pandemic.

### Problems to solve

People who stay physically, mentally, socially and spiritually active have better mental health than those who don't. When we stay active, we feel happier and at the same time find it easier to deal with everyday challenges.
In addition, it can alleviate psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. (Meilstrup, et al. 2022)

Avoiding a bad mental and physical state amongst users in GBN and lowering risks of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment as a derivative effect of a pandemic.

### Value proposition

Better mental health is associated with lower health costs. Citizens who have a high level of mental health and, for example, are optimistic and have surpluses, do not use the public health system nearly as much as others. (Santini, Nielsen, et al., Mental health economics: A prospective study on psychological flourishing and associations with healthcare costs and sickness benefit transfers in Denmark 2021). Keeping a healthy mental state amongst users in a GBN should be of high importance always and especially during a pandemic.

### Capabilities

Measures focusing on physical, social, mental and spiritual activities could be implemented in countless ways and could range from establishing permanent sports facilities in the GBN to promote small social and mental activities such as board games in the GBN. The activities and measures could originate from a broad range of stakeholders in the GBN, from GBN owner, building users, local organisations etc.

### Restrictions and limitations

The measures should of course be consistent with or adapted to any current restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distancing, prohibition of gathering etc..
