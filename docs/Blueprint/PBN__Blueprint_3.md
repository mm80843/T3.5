# __Indoor environmental quality ieq monitoring system__

## Capabilities of the blueprint

The proposed architecture is based on several low-cost sensors for data acquisition and a single-board computer as coordinator, as well as on various communication technologies. The measured variables make it possible to identify unpleasant and potential risk situations and to take corrective measures. In addition, the system can use historical data to decide when to take certain actions.

## Context of the blueprint

This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings. The relative transmission risk for airborne diseases would be associated for example with CO2 level, as an indicator of inadequate ventilation or of overcrowded spaces.

## Blueprint description

Over the last years, and for several reasons, IEQ monitoring systems have become important for several reasons: 
•	 guaranteeing adequate air quality
•	 ensuring thermal comfort for users
•	 ensuring the users wellbeing
•	 provide adequate natural or artificial lighting
•	 ensuring that noise levels are not excessive
•	 take measures to reduce energy consumption
In this scenario, the application of IoT in this type of system enables the collection of data as well as the remote control of air systems. With this approach, an IoT architecture could be proposed that aims to monitor indoor air quality in buildings with high occupancy to reduce the risk of contamination.

## Problem of the blueprint

Apart from controlling contamination risks, continuous monitoring of parameters such as temperature, relative humidity or CO2 makes it possible to keep the environmental quality within a target range. This eliminates the problem of energy waste due to excessive consumption, typical in offices and public buildings. 

## Reason of the blueprint

Studies have shown there is a significant correlation between general air quality and the spread of contagious diseases indoors, as some air quality measures can be a good proxy measure for ventilation and adequate supply of fresh air. This is why CO2 and occupancy measurements for example can be considered as important. Monitoring these parameters can help decide where and when to take action in an intelligent and efficient way, for example through automatic ventilation systems. In addition, thermal, visual and acoustic comfort would always be maintained.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

A potential limitation of the system may be the limitations of the HVAC systems themselves, as well as other systems impacting environmental parameters. As a result, indoor air quality may not be adequate despite the system's measures. Morevoer, the cost for the equipement and operation tends to be high.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

The proposed IEQ monitoring system will first enable the detection of the rise of environmental indicators related to the spread of contagious diseases, which in turn will enable the implementation of intelligent and informed decisions and actions. In addition, ensuring the physiological needs of users will also lead to a better response of the immune system to potential infections.
