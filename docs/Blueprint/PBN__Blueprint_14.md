## Property: has_BPReason

Good hand hygiene has long been fundamental to patient safety in hospitals and in healthcare in general. By consistently washing and disinfecting our hands, we prevent the spread of infections through hand contact.

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

For effective implementation of this measure, it is important to assess the primary user group(s) of the building and the impact of their characteristics on the measures to be implemented.  For example, the measures in a kindergarten would be very different from those on a university campus.  Therefore, it is important to assess this so that the information and active measures are targeted to the current user group to achieve the greatest impact 
Hand hygiene can be monitored directly through user observation or self-reporting, or indirectly by monitoring the consumption of disinfectants (soap and hand sanitizer).

## Property: has_BPPermanent

Permanent & Temporary

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

Implementing measures to ensure high hand hygiene is a low-tech measure to reduce infection risks. These measures are easy to implement and easy to withdraw, which gives them a short response time and high flexibility, also with regard to later relocation in the building.
Implementation and operating costs are relatively low compared to more technically complex and comprehensive measures.

## Property: has_BPProblem

The aim of this design is to reduce the transmission of diseases through direct hand-to-hand contact between users or the transmission of diseases through surfaces (fomites).

## Property: has_BPRestriction

Changing user behaviour can be challenging, but once a positive behaviour is established, it is easier to maintain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of hand sanitizers occurred regularly due to rapidly increasing demand. In addition, frequent use of soap or hand sanitizers may cause dry and irritated skin.

## Property: has_BPDescription

A high level of hand hygiene is a well-known and proven measure to prevent the transmission of diseases. It was and is a widely used strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This blueprint serves as a reminder of this measure to ensure that all building occupants adhere to the basic requirement of good hand hygiene to reduce the transmission of disease between building occupants. Discipline in hand hygiene can be increased or maintained through a variety of measures, focusing either on practical measures that provide access to hand washing or disinfecting products, or on information that reminds or guides occupants to use the measures. This measure includes development of specific hand hygiene policies and active training of the users of the buildings on the good hand hygiene practice. 

## Property: has_BPContext

Hand sanitizers should be available at all key points in the building. This could be at the entrances to the building/premises/populated space, at the entrances and exits of stairwells, in canteen areas, at high use areas such as coffee and vending machines, etc Information and instructions for users, e.g. signs at toilets indicating good hand hygiene, reminders to use hand sanitizers at strategic locations, etc.
