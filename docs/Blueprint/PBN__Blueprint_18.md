# __Animal vectors control measures__

## Problem of the blueprint

Continuous control of animal vectors prevents infestations and thus reduces the risk of spreading diseases and other health risks such as severe allergic reactions or asthma attacks. In addition, the risk of property damage will be much lower.

## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_19

## Description of the blueprint

Animal vector control methods and technologies are central to preventing the transmission of vector-borne diseases from animals to occupants (zoonosis) and users of buildings and/or GBN. More traditional methods of controlling animal vectors in buildings include the large-scale use of pesticides and insecticides. However, there is a trend towards less toxic measures in EU countries. As a result, several countries have introduced more complex pest control strategies that include several non-chemical approaches. Integrated Pest Management (IPM), for example, is, as the title suggests, a programme that uses more than one technique at four levels of implementation: 
•	 identify the pest species that occur in a given area in order to take targeted preventive measures (see below). in addition, this phase includes routine monitoring of the most infested areas and an analysis of the effectiveness of the measures applied
•	 establishment of thresholds for the implementation of certain measures to enable informed decision-making.
•	 prevention
•	 application of the lowest risk pest control methods such as trapping, eradication or local application of pesticides and insecticides if non-toxic methods have not brought the success determined by the thresholds

## GBN Phase of the blueprint

## Capabilities of the blueprint

A sound and comprehensive management plan to control animal vectors is as important as training for building occupants and technical staff, including pest prevention and control professionals.

## Mode of transmission covered by the blueprint

Direct contact & Fomite

## Reason of the blueprint

In areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic (e.g. dengue fever, malaria, West Nile virus), care should be taken to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate their breeding sites within infrastructure. Climate change will extend the range of disease-carrying mosquitoes further north, so that malaria could also pose a threat in southern Europe in the coming decades. In addition, COVID -19 was the most recent example of a zoonosis spreading worldwide, but other diseases such as the Zika virus, dengue fever and SARS are also among the epidemics. According to 2016 UNEP estimates, about 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from animals. In addition, numerous studies confirm the hypothesis that animals that choose the urban environment as their natural habitat, especially rodents, insects and birds, carry significantly greater amounts of pathogens than animals in other habitats.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

The implementation of IMP or other integrating measures that opt for rather non-toxic and innovative solutions will not only reduce the risk of disease spread among building occupants, but will also lead to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transformation. Pest control will also lead to significant cost savings, as even a small infestation can lead to high investments.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

The main obstacle to effective prevention and control of animal vectors is the inability or even lack of knowledge exchange between trained professionals, as well as the lack of expertise in non-traditional methods, which are still widely used in many EU countries. Furthermore, innovation in this particular sector cannot be considered rapid and there are currently not many alternatives to traditional methods. Moreover, training of personnel migh be costly and use of toxic pesticides and insecticides can harm the environment.

## Context of the blueprint

This measure is to be applied in all GBN buildings, but it is known that some categories of buildings or certain areas within buildings (such as storage areas, low-quality shelters or eating areas) are more susceptible to the occurrence of animal vectors 
Examples of mosquito control would be:
•	 fly screens on opening windows
•	 air curtains on external doors (if fitted - in most cases this is neither cost nor energy efficient)
•	 preventing accumulations of standing water (e.g. containers where rainwater can collect, blocked gutters)
In addition, rodents such as mice and rats can carry diseases such as hantaviruses. To prevent rodent infestation of a building, it is important to keep it clean, including
•	 removing potential nesting material (e.g. shredded paper, dried plant debris)
•	 storing waste (especially food waste) in containers with tight-fitting lids
•	 storing food in thick plastic or metal containers with tight-fitting lids
•	 sealing cracks or holes in external walls
