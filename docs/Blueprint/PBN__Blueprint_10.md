# __Installing uv in ductwork__

## Capabilities of the blueprint

The correct adjustment of the UV-C radiation variables (intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation) significantly changes the performance of the system. Therefore, the system can be adjusted to reduce the presence of certain microorganisms as needed.
According to existing literature, it is possible to inactivate 90-99.9% of microorganisms (including the SARS-CoV virus) by installing UV-C lamps.
UV-C irradiation is very flexible and depends on the strategy for controlling microorganisms. Various analogue systems can be found on the market: In-channel systems, upper room decontamination systems and mobile systems on rollers.

## Context of the blueprint

UV-C lamps are used in unoccupied spaces (either in ducts or in a room) to purify air streams that enter occupied spaces (e.g., health care facilities, offices, schools, public buildings, etc.)

## Demonstration of the blueprint

Chicagoâ€™s Loyola University Medical Center

## Blueprint description

UV is one of the most common environmental control measures for elimination of microorganism while airborne transmission is one of the main ways of spreading many diseases. Normally, the concentration of airborne pathogens in enclosed spaces is mitigated by natural or mechanical ventilation systems. In this context, it should be noted that ventilation systems are designed for the comfort of the users, so in some scenarios (e.g. pandemic) the recommended air change per hour for controlling airborne infections cannot be achieved. UV-C can effectively supplement ventilation and inactivate harmful sources of disease before air flows reach occupied spaces.

## Problem of the blueprint

Since infectious diseases are often airborne, HVAC systems can have a major impact on the transmission of disease from one place to another. Installing UV-C light in ventilation ducts allows microorganisms to be inactivated without seriously affecting the operation of HVAC systems.

## Reason of the blueprint

UV-C irradiation is an 80-year-old technology that has been successfully used to reduce the spread of microorganisms safely, quietly, effectively and economically. UV-C for germicidal spread control works primarily by damaging nucleic acids (DNA RNA) that are ubiquitous in pathogenic microbes. Effectiveness against current and future pathogens is therefore guaranteed, provided the light dose is appropriate.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

UV-C can attack certain materials, particularly plastics used in ventilation systems, so a shielding solution may be required. For maintenance personnel, UV-C radiation can be harmful to eyes and skin.  The installation of UV lamps in the ventilation ducts is expensive and requires regular maintenance, especially because of dust deposits that render the lamps ineffective. This measure is no substitute for the highly efficient air philtres in the ventilation networks, as the particles remain in the air.
