# __Access control, limitation, or lockdown__

## Problem of the blueprint

The measure limits the contact between individuals and avoids overcrowding if limitations are localised. 

## Demonstration of the blueprint

Access limitation was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic

## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_8

## Description of the blueprint

One of the most drastic measures to prevent the spread of COVID -19 during the spike periods was to restrict access to certain buildings or prevent it altogether. During the peak of the lockdowns, many employers closed their buildings and asked their employees to work from home if possible. With the partial normalisation of the situation (decline in case numbers, vaccination coverage and milder variants), these restrictions became less severe and targeted specific groups (vulnerable or symptomatic individuals), types of buildings (hospitals and prisons) or specific spaces within buildings (non-essential, high-visibility areas). These restrictions have been imposed at national, regional and organisational levels. In addition, this measure also provides for restrictions based on occupancy density.

## GBN Phase of the blueprint

Design & Operational

## Capabilities of the blueprint

Thanks to technology and the DT, the possibilities for controlling access and the flow of people can be greatly improved. Various solutions are conceivable 
•	 checkpoints for access limitation
•	 sensors to monitor occupancy
•	 teleworking 
•	 appointment scheduling system

## Mode of transmission covered by the blueprint

Airborne & Respiratory & Direct Contact

## Reason of the blueprint

Controlling access is one of the most important points in limiting the spread of a virus limiting the number of human interactions.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

By imposing stricter social-distancing rules, individuals are less likely to be infected, and even more so those who are particularly vulnerable. The ability to send employees home will also ensure business continuity.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

Various adverse cost are linked to this measure: 
•	 restricting access is above all depriving individuals of freedom of movement. 
•	 legislative issues due to the restriction of free movement  
•	 essential services cannot be limited and therefore those employed within those sectors face much bigger danger
•	 emergencies can be complicated to manage: unforeseen situations that require immediate attention
•	 alternative solutions need to be found in order to keep business-as-usual
•	 potentially high cost of operating infrastructure to restrict access
•	 lower levels of work morale due to the introduction of remote working
•	 increased surveillance could lead to social consequences

## Context of the blueprint

As mentioned above, the context varies depending on the severity of the actual pandemic situation, as different interpretations and levels of action may be applied. It has been shown that during the largest outbreaks, most non-essential activities were carried out from home, resulting in lower transmission rates.
