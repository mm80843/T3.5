## Property: has_BPProblem

The biggest challenge with this solution is its implementation. How is a building deconstructed while its elements are preserved? What resources will be needed for this? How long will it take?

## Property: has_BPRestriction

The limitations and restrictions of this solution also stem from its innovative aspect. Although it is a great way to build and dismantle, it is still new and not everyone is familiar with it. The challenge is for GBN's management team to be able to discover the solution and make the most of it in terms of time management, costs, waste management and human resources.

Design & Dismantling

## Property: has_BPDescription

COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of converting certain spaces into health-related facilities to meet the high demand for certain purposes. In response, either the capacity of existing structures was changed or buildings (such as stadiums or exhibition centres) were converted into treatment and quarantine facilities or vaccination centres. As the demand for these versatile spaces fluctuates greatly during the pandemic, constructing buildings for a single purpose is no longer considered practical. Therefore, a paradigm shift has led the architectural industry to recognise the importance of dynamic and adaptable buildings and their multifunctionality throughout their life cycle

## Property: has_BPTransmission

All

## Property: has_BPReason

The purpose of such a solution is to ensure the flexibility of the design to accommodate effectively the demand as circumstances and constraints change and therefore maximising its value throughout the whole lifecycle.

Technical

## Property: has_BPTitle

Building adaptation for flexible  use

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

Architects are being pushed to design more flexible and simpler structures that are easy to assemble. Some of these structures can also be prefabricated and only need to be transported to the desired destination. The elements of adaptable buildings are numerous and range from movable walls, flexible ducts, removable or collapsible elements, interchangeable components to modular units.

## Property: has_BPPermanent

Only to used when needed

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

The biggest advantage of this solution is its innovation. In order to change a building, in most cases we used to have to destroy the part that was to be changed. The destroyed part could then be reused to create a new element. But here, the scale of the recycled element is changed forever, so that a new building design can be tackled more quickly.
