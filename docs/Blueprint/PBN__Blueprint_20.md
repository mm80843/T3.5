# __Infection tracking__

## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_21

## Value proposition of the blueprint

Infection tracking and monitoring is a robust decision-making tool that supports the implementation and updating of the security strategy in the event of an epidemic by providing real-time data that is critical in such an event.

## Demonstration of the blueprint

During the outbreak of COVID -19 this method was frequently used and proved to be efficient.

## Problem of the blueprint

As far as tracking and surveillance of infections is concerned, the challenge lies in the efficiency and reliability of tracking and surveillance methods and devices. These are directly related to case definition and thus knowledge of the disease. However, if it is an unknown or new epidemic, the case definition cannot be accurately confirmed, creating grey areas where the epidemic can spread unnoticed.

## Context of the blueprint

Depending on the case definition, infection tracking and surveillance for non-residents could be done every time they enter a GBN, while tracking and surveillance for residents in GBNs could be updated daily, regardless of whether they have spent the entire last 24 hours in a GBN or not.

## Capabilities of the blueprint

Tracking and surveillance of infections must be efficient by tracking and monitoring diseases in all residents of the GBN, but also in all persons who enter the GBN during the day, whether for a delivery, a job or a service. The tracking and surveillance material should be able to detect common infectious viruses or bacteria as well as all types of registered epidemic diseases. In addition, the system needs to be updated as soon as health authorities report a new disease or outbreak. The use of robots capable of diagnosing a disease is also on the rise and it is expected that the need for human resources for testing purposes will be less.

## Reason of the blueprint

Tracking infections is useful in the first phase of the spread of an epidemic, especially if it is a new contagious event. However, tracking first requires establishing a case definition of when a person is considered infected. Once this starting point is established, tracking the disease spread provides information on transmission routes, transmission rates, virulence and consequences of the disease. This initial information will serve as the basis for developing (or adapting) the response plan to ensure the safety of GBN residents. In a second phase, infection monitoring supports the evaluation of the effectiveness of the response plan and thus the hopefully declining spread of the epidemic based on the same case definition as in the tracking phase. This includes the identification of persons who have been in close contact with a person who has tested positive for a disease with a higher transmission potential.

## Description of the blueprint

Tracking and surveillance of infections allows better assessment of the spread of an epidemic in real time. Depending on the extent of surveillance and tracking, this method will allow the determination of characteristic elements of the epidemic, such as its virulence factor and infectivity. This will enable real-time risk assessment, which is critical for decision-making to ensure the safety of GBN residents. It is expected that a clear testing and surveillance strategy would be adapted at GBN and/or building level and applied in the event of a pandemic. Potential disease tracking would be achieved through the use of rapid antigen testing to rapidly identify some very infectious individuals and PCR testing for individuals who have been in close contact with an infected person.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

The restrictions and limitations of this proposal primarily concern data collected through tracking and surveillance. These data, in particular individual identity and health status, should only be used for their original purpose, namely tracking and surveillance of infections and nothing else. The effectiveness of tracking also relies heavily on a quick responsiveness which was not always the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other limitation contain: 
•	 the cost of testing and analysis of subsequent data
•	 the cost of tracking of infected people
•	 the environmental impact from the plastic waste from the disposables
•	 testing can be inaccurate and can give false sense of security or vice-versa.
