# __Adapted architectural design__

## Problem of the blueprint

The main problem solved by this measure is the fact that previous architectural designs did not take precautions to minimise contamination, especially with regard to social distancing, hygiene measures or the use of other built-in solutions.

## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_3

## Description of the blueprint

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted densely populated areas. It is recognized that there is an urgent need to rethink architectural design processes and choose the right designs that can minimise the risk of contamination between users of the space. The move away from open-space concepts in separate spaces is already evident in many short-term solutions for redesigning spaces, so to take into account the reduction of contamination risks.

## GBN Phase of the blueprint

Design

## Capabilities of the blueprint

To implement this measure as effectively as possible, a good understanding of the right way to design architecture and the related context of systems thinking is crucial. Lessons learned from previous health events have already been incorporated into a new approach to architecture in various ways, for example by promoting smooth surfaces and geometric design to reduce the problem of dust accumulation and other contaminants. 

## Mode of transmission covered by the blueprint

All

## Reason of the blueprint

More and more architectural projects implement mitigation measures at the outset so that the users of the physical space can actually comply with these measures, especially in terms of social distancing. This helps avoid additional ad hoc measures if the architectural design is carried out properly, and the measures are an integral part of the building from the very beginning

## Value proposition of the blueprint

Embedding general resilience and specific mitigation measures into architectural design will have the effect of reducing the additional costs that could be incurred in the event of a health event. As there is a global trend is towards more resilient infrastructure, incorporating this measure at the beginning of the project will certainly lead to future standards being met later down the line.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

The main obstacle is that it is very difficult to apply these features to existing designs and/or buildings. Another limitation could be the current state of the art, e.g. ventilation systems, automatic doors and other non-contact features that have only been studied in more detail in recent years. The constructuon of transmission-prone buildings can also be costly.

## Context of the blueprint

This measure is especially important at the beginning of the planning phase of new or renovated buildings and spaces. There is a consensus that the trend is towards larger and less dense spaces with lower capacity and better ventilation.
