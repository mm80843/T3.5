## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_24

## Description of the blueprint

It is well known that physical activity or exercise is essential for improving and/or maintaining physical and mental health. The pandemic COVID 19 has had a significant impact on our daily lives, not only during the strict cordons or possible quarantine periods, but also during the long periods of gradual reopening. The pandemic has drawn attention to the positive benefits of physical activity and the disadvantages of not doing it. This approach aims to integrate facilities that promote physical activity among GBN users to maintain or improve mental health. Facilities can promote both planned and unplanned physical activity in GBN. Planned physical activity can be expressed through sports facilities or other facilities that facilitate various activities such as ball games, yoga or the like. Unplanned physical activity can be expressed through building or interior design that encourages users to be more active, e.g. through inviting pathways and easy choices. The measures can be indoor measures in the individual buildings of the GBN as well as outdoor measures in green spaces or on roofs.

## GBN Phase of the blueprint

Design and Operational

## Capabilities of the blueprint

Physical activity has a number of known health benefits in addition to its positive effects on mental health. Improving physical activity can be done in a number of ways. The most common is the provision of gyms or other facilities for physical activity and related activities, but there are also other elements that promote physical activity and active travel, such as showers, changing rooms, bicycle racks or attractive staircases.

## Mode of transmission covered by the blueprint

Not relevant

## Reason of the blueprint

People who stay active physically, mentally, socially and spiritually have better mental health than people who don't. People who stay active feel happier and at the same time are better able to cope with the challenges of daily life. Physical activity can help maintain or improve mental health and relieve mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Regular physical activity is effective, and alternative forms of physical activity are a key strategy for maintaining mental health and well-being during a pandemic such as COVID -19.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

This action aims to maintain or improve the mental health of GBN users, and therefore their general health and wellbeing. it is not intended as a mean to stop or reduce the spread of disease.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

An official restriction in times of epidemics or pandemics could limit the use of facilities, so that physical activities do not become a source of contamination by themselves. Investment in building and operation can be high in most cases.

## Context of the blueprint

Studies shows that nearly all types of physical activity are helpful and both physical exercise training and relaxation training can buffer the negative effects of stress on general health and mental health. This is important to implement in daily rutines.
