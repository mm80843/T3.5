## Property: has_BPReason

It is known that use of HEPA filters reduce the presence of virus particles in the air. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic a great number of studies and experiments have proven that highly efficient particle filters can capture extremely small particles, including the COVID-19 virus as well as large variety of other airborne contaminants.  

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

The use of HEPA filters is widespread and has been used in cities since the 1950s to maintain health and therefore its use in the vast majority of buildings and their HVAC networks was tested. The effectiveness can be further improved by incorporating pre-filters (to remove larger particles), UV light or antimicrobial coating (to remove viruses and bacteria) into the filter.

In general terms, this measure provides the following
•	 reducing the risk of spreading diseases through indoor air
•	 filtering other harmful particles such as volatile organic compounds (voc)
•	 reduces levels of allergens and mould spores in the air
•	 removes odours
•	 not as harmful as other air treatment technologies such as ionisation or ozone.
•	 reducing the risk of airborne disease spread indoors

HEPA filters are crucial in preventing the spread of bacterial and viral organisms in the air. It has been proven that HEPA filters has to remove at least 99.97% of particles from the air down to at least 0.3 microns in size. For instance, aerosol transmission of COVID-19 results from particles that are between 1 to 50 microns.  As HEPA filters can trap small particles, this measure reduces the risk of spreading disease and prevents the accumulation of further infectious particles on surfaces.

## Property: has_BPRestriction

The limitations of this proposal include that the filter loses efficiency due to its clogging. As a result, the air supply would decrease, leading to stagnant air.  To ensure that filters function properly, regular maintenance and replacement of filters (six months in commercial and office buildings and one to two years in residential buildings) must be carried out. In addition, the main limitation is that pollutants trapped in the filter can still release small particles (e.g. endotoxins released by accumulated bacteria) that pass through the filter. Moreover, equipping the entire HVAC system with high-efficiency filtres requires higher investment and continuous maintenance.

## Property: has_BPDescription

This blueprint proposes the use of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters as a means of decontaminating COVID-19 aerosols in public and enclosed spaces to protect not only from the COVID-19 but also from other infectious agents. For an air purifier to effectively remove viruses from the air, it must be able to remove small particles (in the size range of 0.1-1 um) from the air, which is the case with HEPA filters. These air purifiers can either be installed in the ventilation networks or they can be mobile and stand-alone and used in cases where installing the philtres in the networks is not plausible or in rooms where infected or susceptible people are present.

## Property: has_BPContext

HEPA filters are generally used in the ventilation networks of buildings or in certain areas where overcrowding is expected. The use of HEPA filters in buildings and areas where contamination control is required (e.g. hospitals) is an unwritten rule.
