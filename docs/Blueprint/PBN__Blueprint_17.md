# __Wastewater monitoring__

## Capabilities of the blueprint

For this measure to be most useful, it is important to select a broad panel of markers that provide information on:
•	 pathogenic organisms (bacteria and viruses)
•	 biochemical markers associated with physiological responses
•	 markers for intervention (drugs) 
•	 markers for antimicrobial resistance

## Context of the blueprint

This measure is effective as long as the residential area is in operation and the monitoring team includes epidemiologists as well as environmentalists.

## Blueprint description

Already a year ago, the European Commission recommended that EU member states set up a wastewater monitoring programme to track COVID-19 and its variants. As a result, circa 1370 wastewater treatment plants in the EU are now regularly monitored. This draft aims to transfer this practise to the neighbourhood level. Monitoring of wastewater has proven to be a reliable source of information to detect the presence of the virus or the increase or decrease in levels of virus, without the need to test individual people. In this context, the following blueprint proposes to equip relevant GBN wastewater sites with the right tools and sensors to collect regular data on pathogen concentrations, enabling guidelines and policy decisions.

## Problem of the blueprint

Surveillance and monitoring of pathogens in wastewater complements current infectious disease surveillance systems and serves as an early warning system for disease outbreaks across entire communities and can provide useful information on the presence of viruses and on the intensity and geographical spread of the virus. Moreover, this will also include the data from asymptomatic individuals who would not be traced by the usual means. 

## Reason of the blueprint

Past experience with other viral diseases, such as polio, hepatitis A and norovirus, has shown that effluent-based epidemiology is an effective tool to detect the presence of pathogens and provide a clear indication of increasing or decreasing transmission. In addition, continuous monitoring of wastewater enables early detection of viral mutations/variants that allow precautionary measures to be taken. On the other hand, the good correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and the concentration of pathogens measured in some EU wastewater treatment plants shows that this approach is effective in providing actionable data on the outbreaks of pandemics.

## Restrictions of the blueprint

Although no data is collected on specific individuals, several ethical aspects of this measure can be discussed. It is generally accepted that a population size of more than > 10,000 is sufficient to ensure anonymity and not pose a risk. This number is far from the number of people who might live in a neighbourhood. As a result, some people might be stigmatised by the measure. On the other hand, a smaller number of people may also have an impact on the sensitivity of the system (lower concentrations of pathogens). Moreover, the data gathered through wastewater monitoring cannot replace the data that is gathered by clinical surveillance but might overcome some of its limitations such as the size of the sample. It is also not very representative in case of low levels of disease spread and does not take into account any changes in the presence of individuals (seasonal such as holidays or occasional due to bad weather for instance). Last, standardized method is required for the data to be interpreted in the same manner across various areas. Moreover, high cost of equipement and need for regular maintenance on site might discourage implementation of this measure.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

In general terms, this blueprint provides a cheap, rapid and robust tool of tracking diseases. The ability of this measure to rapidly monitor the spread of disease is key for prevention, intervention and control.
