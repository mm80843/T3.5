# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_2__ (PBN__Blueprint_1)

## Property: has_BPProblem

This solution ensures non-contact delivery of goods, minimising the transmission of diseases through the delivery of goods from the shop to the customer. In addition, this measure prevents overcrowding by avoiding bottlenecks caused by queues during collection or the goods being lost, stolen or broken.  Last but not least, smart lockers will reduce operating costs and provide savings for commercial properties.

## Property: has_BPDescription

Following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce companies have invested heavily in the development of contactless parcel delivery networks, particularly smart locker technologies that eliminate any person-to-person contact when the order is picked up by a special password or QR code in a dedicated room that can be enhanced with other measures to protect against transmissions. This could be extended to any GBN, especially for local delivery of goods.

## Property: has_BPContext

Due to their nature, smart lockers can be accessible 24 hours a day, leaving it up to the customer to decide whether to access them within a certain period of time, which depends on traffic, but in almost all cases is no less than 24 hours. As some other industries have realised, this solution can also be applied to their needs. The hospitality industry, as well as many large corporations and universities, are using this measure to encourage touch-free delivery of food, documents, books, etc. in areas with somewhat higher occupancy rates. As mentioned earlier, the lockers must be placed in a specific location and continuous activity must be guaranteed even when the end user is not present.

## Property: has_BPReason

Smart lockers allow their users to collect their goods more safely in terms of contagious disease risks, as contactless delivery promotes better social distancing. It also makes collection more convenient, as consumers can choose from a wide range of collection locations and times. From a business perspective, smart lockers allow for more cost-efficient and flexible delivery of goods as the system is simpler compared to traditional methods. In addition, the transport of goods is more secure as every single step can be tracked through automated protocols.

## Property: has_BPRestriction

A number of limitations have been identified for this specific measure:
•	 most of today's systems cannot automatically close the locker door: it is not contactless. 
•	 older adults' perceptions of technology and barriers to interaction.
•	 non-acceptance by users
•	 vandalism
•	 need for good cleaning of the locker system
•	 system crash
•	 power outages
•	 need for strict hygiene measures in the area where the lockers are located
•	 carrying capacity at peak time - limited capacity if the user does not collect the goods quickly
•	 inability to carry large parcels 
•	 partial job destruction

A number of prerequisites are necessary for the implementation of this measure. These include the smart lockers themselves, the placement of these lockers, a mobile app that allows both businesses and their customers track and manage the delivery of goods, and a robust logistics plan to make delivery not only cost-effective but also flexible.

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

The smart locker system is widely seen as a innovative way to attract new customers and/or visitors by offering them more flexibility (in terms of time and choice of delivery location) and optimised delivery of their goods.
