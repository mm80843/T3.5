# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_6__ (PBN__Blueprint_5)

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

In order to implement this measure as cost-effectively as possible, it would be crucial to analyse and find the main touch points for the application of the measure. The scope of the implementation of the measure would need to be determined and established, as this will have an impact on the possibilities of the measure.

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

This measure is a first barrier to ward off the spread of infectious diseases via surfaces and is a passive protective measure.  This could lead to an increase in user confidence as it reduces some of the imbalance in manual hand hygiene among users.

## Property: has_BPTitle

Antimicrobial Surfaces

## Property: has_BPDescription

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus shifted to reducing the transmission of pathogens via contaminated objects and surfaces. Antimicrobial surfaces with inherent, long-lasting anti-pathogen properties at key contact points, such as busy door handles, are one of the measures available to reduce the risk of transmission.

## Property: has_BPRestriction

Higher costs as it entails a more complex processing of parts carried out in the design phase or on existing products in the building. Moreover, regular inspections are necessary to ensure that the coating on parts is performing its function, which will lead to higher operating costs 
The measure could lead to reduced hand hygiene for some users, which could lead to increased transmission of pathogens for products without the antimicrobial surfaces.
The effectiveness of these coatings is still questioned by both scientist and users. In addition users may face a an allergic reaction the compounds of the coating or the coating may peel off and possibly have negative environmental impacts.

## Property: has_BPProblem

Keep contact points that are frequently used free of pathogens to reduce contaminations.

## Property: has_BPReason

The main effect of applying antimicrobial properties to key products in buildings is to reduce the transmission of pathogens thanks to the materials in question. When communicated to users, it can lead to an increased perception of safety among users and have a positive impact on the use of the asset and its services.

## Property: has_BPPermanent

Permanent

## Property: has_BPContext

The materials or coating application can be used at contact points that are used several times a day by different people ( e.g. in public toilets, entrance areas, etc.) The measure could be applied in the design phase of a new appliance,, or it could possibly be applied to existing appliances (handles, ..) in the building as a coating of the surface. The measure does not affect the original functionality or design of the product, but enhances the existing product by making it safer to use.
