# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_9__ (PBN__Blueprint_8)

## Property: has_BPProblem

Provision required information to the biggest possible audience and make it accessible for those who are not using general information channels. Using information from verified channels / sources will hinder misinformation. 

## Property: has_BPDescription

The idea is to turn high-traffic points into hubs of a networked system for communicating relevant information to building users/GBNs to ensure much greater visibility, easier, engaging and comprehensive communication, and immediacy of H&S analysis and messages, commitments and recommendations. This will bring a clear definition of relevant criteria and communication processes, which in turn will improve the ability to prevent critical points before reactive phases. The nature of provided information can vary from the summary of current pandemic situation, update on legislative measures to information specific to the building or GBN including its environmental parameters monitoring. 

## Property: has_BPContext

The measure is conceived for the both the- buildings’ users and general public within the GBNs. Information hubs can be physical locations such as entry and exit points, intersections, waiting areas, public transport or similar that could act as information points. This measure can be further enhanced by smartphone applications, intranet or other online information systems creating a channel to the GBN users.

## Property: has_BPReason

To ensure that important information reaches all relevant people. Indeed, during the COVID-19 pandemic has made society realise how important is the timely dissemination and right formulation of relevant information in combating disease outbreaks by promoting correct decision-making at both organisational and individual levels. Therefore, these information points are of great importance as they will provide much greater visibility, tailoring and compliance with the implemented regulations and recommendations.  

## Property: has_BPRestriction

Repetitive messages and individuals losing interest gradually  
Messages that are not suitable for all types of building users
Outdated or misleading information

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

The information points will share information on the following topics
•	emergency information and warnings in real time
•	possible explanation of the reasons for a higher rate of disease spread in a particular area of the building/gbn
•	references to legislation and guidance on health and safety in the workplace
•	visual and interactive recommendations on how to improve personal hygiene and sanitary habits
•	 further information on health and safety in the workplace, such as the nearest hospital or the location of first aid kits
•	  information about specific rooms in relation to ongoing, completed or planned hygiene measures (e.g. deep cleaning in rooms with registered disease cases)
•	  sensor-monitored occupancy levels (both for hot-desk reservation system & space usage information) and wayfinding signage to disperse the users into less occupied spaces
