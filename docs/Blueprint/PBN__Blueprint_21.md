# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_22__ (PBN__Blueprint_21)

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

This BP is essentially based on continuous monitoring of biofilm growth in distribution networks. Today, there are several devices that can be installed either directly in the river or in a bypass line to assess this problem. Examples of these devices are optical biofilm sensors and electrochemical sensors. This measure again requires activated carbon filtres to eliminate the risk of contamination of household water.

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

In general, BP can be used to monitor the attachment of biofilms, which provides meaningful information for optimising the parameters of distribution systems. On the other hand, activated carbon philtres remove all kinds of impurities that may still be present in tap water.

## Property: has_BPTitle

Drinking Water Safety - Biofilm formation

## Property: has_BPDescription

Fortunately, most tap water in Europe and North America is drinkable and of very good quality. Nevertheless, there is evidence that treated water contains a small amount of microorganisms. These microorganisms adhere to the side walls of the pipes and form so-called biofilms. The growth of biofilms mainly affects the turbidity, taste, odour and colour of the water and in many cases promotes the degradation of disinfectant residues. On the other hand, several studies have shown that these effects are exacerbated during stagnation.
Considering that during the pandemic many public facilities remained closed for long periods of time, this fact is worrying and a cause for concern, especially when the buildings reopen. This concept involves the use of activated carbon philtres at strategic points in the pipe networks to improve taste and eliminate the risk of contamination, as well as the installation of optical biofilm sensors in the water distribution systems of GBNs to monitor the formation of biofilms. In this way, scheduled pipe cleaning can be carried out, limiting the negative impact of biofilms on drinking water quality and safety.

## Property: has_BPRestriction

Monitoring biofilm growth in water distribution systems is not a simple, time-consuming or costly procedure. The cost of installing and setting up such a monitoring system is not just a one-off cost. Continuous monitoring requires maintenance and handling costs that may limit the implementation of this measure.

## Property: has_BPProblem

Currently, the most widely used method to combat the growth of biofilms in distribution networks is the use of chlorine. This compound is usually dosed in excess, which has a negative impact on the chemical and aesthetic quality of the drinking water. This approach, on the other hand, allows for the timely application of other, more effective control measures (cleaning measures), as well as the response to unforeseen changes in operating conditions that could promote biofilm growth.

## Property: has_BPReason

Activated carbon filtres are cost-effective solutions that retain impurities as the water flows through them. In addition, these systems improve taste and can be installed by almost anyone.
On the other hand, the growth of biofilms in drinking water distribution networks has been shown to affect water properties and, in many cases, promote the deterioration of disinfectant residues. The growth of biofilms in distribution systems also increases flow resistance and affects the hydraulic efficiency of the network in the long term. In addition, biofilms in many cases excrete substances that attack concrete and metal pipes.
Continuous monitoring of biofilm growth in distribution systems is the only way to get a handle on these problems and take action when biofilm formation exceeds a certain threshold. For their part, the activated carbon filtres prevent pathogens from reaching the consumer when a thin biofilm layer is present.
