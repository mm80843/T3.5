# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_17__ (PBN__Blueprint_16)

## Property: has_BPProblem

Improving or maintaining the mental health of GBN users including the decrease of stress levels, reduction in depression and anxiety cases as well as improvement of the general wellbeing. 

## Property: has_BPDescription

This blueprint aims to integrate access to green space into GBN in order to improve or maintain the mental health status of GBN users. The term green space is usually defined as open, undeveloped land with natural vegetation, but is also used in other forms such as urban parks and public open spaces, as well as street trees and green spaces. The use of green space has been associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational studies, demonstrating a positive impact of green space on a wide range of health outcomes. Amongst other researchers have also demonstrated that hospital patients who had a view of a garden from the hospital window recovered more quickly than those who looked out onto a city or industrial area.

## Property: has_BPContext

Access to green space in urban areas such as a GBN is important and useful under normal conditions, but it is of even greater importance at times when the mental health of the population is under pressure, as was the case during the COVID 19 pandemic.  Green spaces should first and foremost be easily accessible on a daily basis to anyone who wishes to enter them. In addition, green spaces should be designed in such a way that they can be used for different purposes, e.g. for sports and exercise or social contacts (e.g. through community gardens, more benches or a chess table).

Behavioural

## Property: has_BPReason

Numerous studies have found a link between spending time in green spaces and nature and stress reduction, better mood, higher life satisfaction, mental stimulation and a lower risk of mental health problems or susceptibility to feelings of loneliness. 

## Property: has_BPRestriction

The unequal distribution of green space within different socio-economic groups is widespread, especially in urban areas. A number of studies have shown that people living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods have symmetrically different access to and quality of green space. Furthermore, the development of green spaces in areas with residents of lower socio-economic status can lead to an increase in property prices and thus accelerate gentrification.

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

In addition to mental health aspects, green spaces can also have a number of other impacts, such as positive effects on biodiversity, climate change impacts, improving overall quality and pricing of the area. In terms of a COVID 19 pandemic, green spaces would also provide opportunities for outdoor activities when people are resting indoors.

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

This intervention aims to maintain or improve the mental health of GBN users and is not designed to prevent the spread of disease. Access to green space has a number of benefits and is central to many urban projects.
