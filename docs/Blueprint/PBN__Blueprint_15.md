# Blueprint: __PBN:BP_16__ (PBN__Blueprint_15)

## Property: has_BPDemonstrated

There is now a wide range of non-contact measures that are widely used but often have a different focus than pandemic adaptation. Sensor control of lighting and doors, for example, is often used in buildings.

## Property: has_BPValueProposition

Many of the measures to reduce contact points are low-tech and low-cost measures that can be implemented in existing buildings as well as in new buildings.

## Property: has_BPRestriction

Existing systems may require certain physical contacts (as with fingerprint solutions).
In addition, stakeholders who physically work in the building cannot exclude physical contact from their daily activities. Sensor control of functions that do not consume energy, such as opening doors, would lead to a small increase in energy consumption. On the other hand, sensor control of lighting, e.g. depending on the presence of staff, would lead to a decrease in energy consumption. Certain contactless technologies (such as facial recognition) could pose an increased risk to privacy or the feeling of surveillance of people and affect the feeling of freedom.  

## Property: has_BPTransmission

Fomites

## Property: has_BPReason

Many pathogens are transmitted by touching contaminated objects, known as fomites. Reducing the number of shared surfaces that people touch, especially high-traffic contact points, will help to reduce the infection risk for fomite-transmitted diseases even during normal, non-pandemic times, helping to keep people healthy.

## Property: has_BPCapabilities

As these measures are already widely used in different contexts, there are a variety of products on the market to meet the needs, as well as a growing catalogue of solutions that include touch-free elements that vary from those widely used such as water taps or lights to more innovative ones such as elevators, coffee machines or doors. 

## Property: has_BPProblem

It has been proven that some diseases (such as chicken pox, common cold or Hepatitis A and B) spread among buildings’ users through transmission via physical contact points and surfaces

## Property: has_BPDescription

This blueprint aims to reduce the number of physical contact points in the building where microbes have been shown to survive, such as surfaces, railings, doorknobs etc. This allows building occupants to avoid touching as many of the same surfaces and physical points as possible, which reduces the risk of contamination. This can be done through a whole range of measures, such as 
•	 installing foot- or sensor-operated door openers on common doors 
•	 updating/retrofitting commonly used equipment such as toilet flushes, coffee machines, vending machines, lift interfaces, taps to a touch-free version
•	 encouraging users to avoid touching shared surfaces 
•	 installing motion-sensing lighting to reduce touching of light switches

## Property: has_BPContext

The aim is to reduce possible cross-contamination points in the building by applying non-contact measures and solutions, especially at highly frequented contact points in the building.
These can be, for example toilet flushes or door handles at central locations with high activity or widely used devices at key points, but also contactless vending machines.
