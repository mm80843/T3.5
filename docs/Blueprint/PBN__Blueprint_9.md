# __Tender support at building stage__

## Problem of the blueprint

Lack of knowledge can lead to important elements being forgotten or excluded during the design phase. Those can include densely used areas or insufficient ventilation network.

## Demonstration of the blueprint

N/A

## Title of the blueprint

PBN:BP_10

## Description of the blueprint

The COVID-19 introduced a new agenda for the built environment: epidemic adaptation and mitigation. This leads to a new approach to building design and operation, the maturity of which is currently low and relatively unexplored. The idea is to create a template with RFP elements related to epidemic adaptation and mitigation that building or space owners can use in the procurement process to ensure a higher level of incorporation of epidemic adaptation and mitigation measures.

## GBN Phase of the blueprint

Design & Construction

## Capabilities of the blueprint

This is based on the regulatory and procurement capabilities of developers/buyers of services.

## Mode of transmission covered by the blueprint

All

## Reason of the blueprint

Tender documents are needed by the project owner to formulate its needs and requirements for its supply chain. Lack of knowledge can lead to important elements being forgotten or omitted at the design stage, resulting in a lack of focus or insight into appropriate actions.

## Value proposition of the blueprint

The value proposition of the blueprint is to provide basic elements of tender documentation that can form a basis for general epidemiologic measures that can be included during the procurement process. This includes, for example, binding information for suppliers and subcontractors on what epidemiological risks can be expected during the projects lifecycle and how to mitigate them and how those can be improved.  

## Restrictions of the blueprint

There is no basis for such procurement. 
Budgetary issues are the main obstacle. In the absence of a mandatory standard, the cheapest solution may be the safest in terms of risk.

## Context of the blueprint

Developers will be subject to future facility health regulations and standards relating to health in facilities and must be able to demonstrate a world-class approach to epidemiological risk.
This can be considered at the early stages of the project when tender documents are submitted.
Standards for the dissemination of information about the building and DT can be established. Specifications for air circulation can be created that the buildings must comply with. The entrance and common areas can be adapted in their functionality and size.

## Type of deployment of the blueprint

Permanent
