## Abstract

The lockdown instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic has
drawn the world’s attention to the importance of homes as
integrated structures for practicing all aspects of life.
The home has been transformed from a mere place to live
into a complete piece of infrastructure accommodating all
activities of life, including study, work, shopping,
exercise, entertainment, and even telehealth. Although
quarantines were necessary to protect against viral
infection, we have faced social and psychological
challenges due to the failure of the current home design to
accommodate the new lockdown lifestyle during the pandemic.
Thus, this study aims to set a foundation for the
development and design of resilient homes in a
post-quarantine world by establishing a comprehensive
framework for quarantine-resilient homes. The framework was
established on the basis of the relevant literature and
proposals from architects and experts. It brings a
perspective to the future requirements of homes so as to
provide architects, stakeholders, and policymakers with the
appropriate knowledge to mitigate the impact of lockdowns
on mental health and well-being in residential buildings by
focusing on the physical and architectural environment.
