## Abstract

The emergence of Big Data, accelerated through the
Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence, from
the emerging, contemporary concept of smart cities coupled
with that of the notion for safe cities is raising concerns
of privacy and good governance that are impacting on
socio-economic and liveability dimensions of urban fabrics.
As these gain ground, largely due to economic pressures
from large ICT providers, there is a notable increase
towards the need for inclusion of human dimensions,
complemented by the use of technology. However, the latter
is seen as catalysing elements of control and propaganda
which are thriving through oversimplified and non-inclusive
urban IT policy measures. This paper dwells on the
intersecting subjects of smart and safe cities and explores
the highlighted issues that are deemed to cause concern and
further explore the need for transparency and inclusivity
in urban processes and systems. This paper is oriented
towards urban planners and policy makers looking at the
implementation of smart and safe cities concepts.
