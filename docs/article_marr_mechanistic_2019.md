## Abstract

Influenza incidence and seasonality, along with virus
survival and transmission, appear to depend at least partly
on humidity, and recent studies have suggested that
absolute humidity (AH) is more important than relative
humidity (RH) in modulating observed patterns. In this
perspective article, we re-evaluate studies of influenza
virus survival in aerosols, transmission in animal models
and influenza incidence to show that the combination of
temperature and RH is equally valid as AH as a predictor.
Collinearity must be considered, as higher levels of AH are
only possible at higher temperatures, where it is well
established that virus decay is more rapid. In studies of
incidence that employ meteorological data, outdoor AH may
be serving as a proxy for indoor RH in temperate regions
during the wintertime heating season. Finally, we present a
mechanistic explanation based on droplet evaporation and
its impact on droplet physics and chemistry for why RH is
more likely than AH to modulate virus survival and
transmission.
