## Summary of the article

Ventilation is important for reducing the risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets that are released when someone sneezes, coughs, or talks. These droplets can travel through the air and land on surfaces, potentially contaminating them. Ventilation systems help by moving the air and diluting these droplets, which makes it less likely for someone to get infected. It's important to make sure the ventilation system is working properly, uses filters that can catch small particles, and brings in fresh air from outside. Maintaining proper ventilation, along with other measures like wearing masks and washing hands, can help keep us safe from COVID-19.

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the importance of ventilation in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nonmedical settings such as offices, schools, and homes. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes, but there is evidence to suggest that smaller droplets, known as aerosols, can also contribute to transmission. Ventilation through natural or mechanical systems can help dilute and disperse these droplets, reducing the risk of infection. Recommendations for using ventilation systems in nonmedical settings include increasing outdoor air ventilation, using high-efficiency air filters, keeping systems running continuously, and adding portable air cleaners or UVGI devices to high-density spaces. Proper maintenance and cleaning of ventilation systems are also important to ensure their effectiveness. While there is debate about the extent of airborne aerosol transmission, implementing ventilation measures along with other preventive measures can help lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission in indoor environments.
