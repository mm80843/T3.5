The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that has affected almost all countries. It is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. The current global preparedness for dealing with pandemics is not very effective, even though there have been some efforts to prepare. It's important for communities to work together and follow certain rules, like washing hands frequently, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and keeping some distance from other people. These actions can help stop the virus from spreading. It's also important to communicate and share information with each other to make sure everyone knows what to do and not to believe in rumors or fake news. The pandemic has also impacted people's mental health, so it's important to stay connected with loved ones through phone or internet, and to seek help from mental health experts if needed. We need to work together and support each other to overcome this pandemic.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed that global preparedness is inadequate in responding to and preventing outbreaks. Technology-driven interventions have been prioritized over engaging communities and obtaining their support in combating epidemics and pandemics. Evidence-based non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing and personal hygiene, are crucial in mitigating the pandemic, especially as pharmaceutical interventions may not be accessible in developing countries for months. Successful containment measures in previous pandemics have included public education, social distancing, home quarantine, and travel restrictions. NPIs, including hand hygiene, respiratory etiquettes, and social distancing, can interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Risk communication strategies should be developed, taking into account the diverse cultures, social norms, education levels, and languages of communities. Trust, transparency, and busting myths and misinformation are essential to engage the public effectively. Mental health also needs to be addressed, as extended lockdowns may cause panic, fear, and irrational behavior. Telecommunication tools, like WhatsApp, can be used for social communication and accessing reliable information. Ensuring social distancing is challenging, particularly in densely populated areas, but surveillance and voluntary reporting are critical. Public engagement and adherence to evidence-based NPIs are necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
