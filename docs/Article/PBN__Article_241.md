There is a disease called COVID-19, which has spread all over the world really quickly. It is a very contagious disease and has caused many deaths. Scientists are using a new technology called blockchain to help fight this disease. Blockchain is a way of storing information that makes it really hard for anyone to change or cheat the information. With blockchain, doctors and authorities can quickly share information about sick people and how to treat them. It can also make donations and news about the disease more transparent and prevent false information from spreading. Blockchain can be really helpful in fighting infectious diseases like COVID-19.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the potential use of blockchain technology in addressing various challenges during infectious disease outbreaks, with a specific focus on the current COVID-19 pandemic. The abstract highlights the global spread and high fatality rate of COVID-19, as well as the occurrence of other novel infectious diseases in recent years. It then introduces blockchain as a technology that enables direct transactions without intermediaries and ensures data reliability and transparency. The abstract discusses the advantages of using blockchain in the field of medicine, particularly during infectious disease outbreaks. It suggests that blockchain can facilitate the quick and accurate sharing of diagnostic and clinical information of infectious disease patients, improving the efficiency of data transfer and decreasing response time. Additionally, blockchain can bring transparency to in-kind and monetary donations, reducing corruption and improving social trust. The technology can also help prevent the spread of false information by storing news and information on a traceable and unalterable blockchain platform. Lastly, the abstract highlights how blockchain can reduce the risk of infection through face-to-face contact by eliminating the need for physical transfer of documents. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the potential of blockchain in addressing the shortcomings of the current system and its role in future infectious disease outbreaks.
