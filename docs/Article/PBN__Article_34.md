This research abstract explores the concept of designing units for living that prioritize the safety and well-being of occupants, both physically and mentally. It discusses the challenges of modern architecture and the emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning as solutions, noting that these approaches can often neglect the importance of nature. The abstract highlights the historical manipulation of nature for aesthetic purposes and the resulting loss of green spaces in urban environments. It argues that humans are outdoor creatures and that artificial environmental conditions can lead to chronic diseases and unhealthy lifestyles. The abstract suggests that building design should prioritize elements such as natural light, ventilation, and connections to nature in order to create a sense of safety and calmness. It proposes integrating nature into living spaces through features like small house gardening. Ultimately, the abstract calls for a more human-centric approach to architecture that considers the physical and emotional needs of occupants, particularly in times of crisis.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

Architects have been designing buildings for people to live in for a long time. But sometimes, these buildings don't make us feel connected to nature and can even make us sick. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are seen as a solution to this problem, but it's not the only answer. In the past, rich people in France used to build big houses with fancy gardens, but these gardens were just to show off and didn't really help people. Nowadays, we need to think about how we can bring nature back into our homes and make sure we have access to fresh air and sunlight. We also need to make sure that buildings are designed with our health in mind, so we can be safe and feel calm. Architects need to focus on designing spaces that are good for people and not just for looks.
