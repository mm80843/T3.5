# __Wearable technology for early detection of COVID-19: A systematic scoping review__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107170

## Short summary of the article

This scoping review examines the use of wearable technology for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. The review identifies 22 types of wearable technology, with smartwatches or fitness trackers being the most frequently used. The mechanisms reported in the literature focus on anomaly detection, with artificial intelligence being the most commonly used approach. However, the ADMs developed lack device-agnosticism and struggle to distinguish COVID-19 from similar diseases. The accuracy of wearable technology varies across studies, with inconsistent reference tests and heterogenous accuracy measures. Overall, the lack of validation standards and the potential for overfitting lead to uncertainty regarding the clinical reliability of wearable technology for early COVID-19 detection. Future research should focus on validation studies with reliable reference tests and larger sample sizes from diverse populations.

## Summary of the article

Scientists are studying wearable technology to see if it can help detect COVID-19 early. Wearable technology includes devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers that you can wear on your body or in your clothing. These devices have sensors that can measure things like your heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygen levels. By monitoring these measurements, scientists hope that wearable technology can help identify changes in your body that might indicate a COVID-19 infection. However, more research is needed to make sure that this technology is accurate and reliable. Right now, it is not clear if wearable technology can be trusted to detect COVID-19 early.
