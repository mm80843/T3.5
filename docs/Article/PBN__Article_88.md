# __Effect of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation on Viral Aerosols__

## DOI of the article

10.1021/es070056u

## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to investigate the UV susceptibility of respiratory viral aerosols and determine the effects of relative humidity (RH) on their UV inactivation rates. The study used three types of viruses: respiratory adenovirus, coronavirus (as a surrogate for SARS coronavirus), and the bacteriophage MS2. Aerosols were generated using a Collison nebulizer and exposed to UV-C irradiation in an experimental chamber. The results showed that the MS2 bacteriophage was more resistant to stress during aerosolization and sampling compared to the coronavirus, which was easily inactivated. Adenovirus showed a similar inactivation rate to MS2. The study also found that the UV susceptibility of viral aerosols was higher compared to viruses suspended in liquid. The effect of RH on UV susceptibility was different from that observed previously for bacterial aerosols. High RH did not provide a protective effect, and the UV susceptibility of viral aerosols was higher at higher RH. Overall, the study suggests that UV air disinfection may be an effective measure against respiratory viral diseases, but further research is needed to optimize UV dosage levels and understand the factors affecting UV susceptibility of viral aerosols.


## Summary of the article

Scientists have been studying how ultraviolet (UV) light can be used to kill harmful viruses and bacteria in the air. They tested different viruses and found that certain viruses, like adenovirus and the coronavirus, were more susceptible to UV light than others. They also found that higher humidity did not protect viruses from UV light, as it does for bacteria. This means that UV light could be effective in killing airborne viruses and preventing the spread of diseases. However, more research is still needed to understand how to best use UV light for this purpose.
