## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes a rapid review of the multidisciplinary literature analyzing the intersection between urban planning and design and pandemics of respiratory diseases in cities. The review identified ten themes in the literature, including scale, built environment, governance and ethics, modelling, non-pharmaceutical interventions, socio-environmental factors, system preparedness, system responses, underserved and vulnerable populations, and future-proofing urban planning and design. The review found that cities are globally interconnected and play a significant role in the spread of respiratory pandemics. The literature emphasized the importance of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions and improving the built environment to prevent and respond to pandemics. It also highlighted the need for effective governance, communication, and preparedness planning at both local and regional levels. The review identified gaps in knowledge, particularly in terms of equity considerations and the role of infrastructure in pandemics. Overall, the review provides a framework for future research and policy responses to better integrate urban planning and design with pandemic preparedness and response efforts.

Respiratory pandemics, urban planning and design: A multidisciplinary rapid review of the literature

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

Cities and urban living are important in the spread of respiratory pandemics like COVID-19. Urban planning and design can help prevent the spread of diseases by creating healthy environments. Measures like handwashing, wearing masks, and social distancing are important in cities. The way cities are built, such as the design of buildings and streets, can also impact the spread of pandemics. Local governments and communities need to work together to respond to and prepare for respiratory pandemics.
