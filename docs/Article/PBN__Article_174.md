This study examines the relationships between the built environment, chronic disease (specifically obesity), and COVID-19 mortality. Using county-level data, the study finds that higher residential density is associated with lower COVID-19 fatality rates, while higher prevalence of obesity is associated with higher fatality rates. The study also finds that certain built environment characteristics, such as pedestrian-oriented design and greater street connectivity, are associated with lower prevalence of obesity. These associations vary across counties, indicating the importance of considering local context. The study highlights the role of unobserved heterogeneity and the need to account for it in analyses. The findings have important implications for policymakers, emphasizing the need for healthier, more walkable environments to combat chronic disease and reduce the impact of infectious diseases like COVID-19. Future research should consider higher-resolution data and examine physical activity outcomes to further understand the relationships between the built environment and health outcomes.

This study looked at how the environment we live in, including things like our neighborhoods and access to parks, can affect our health and the risk of getting sick from diseases like COVID-19. The researchers found that living in areas with more green spaces and places to walk can help reduce the risk of getting chronic diseases like obesity, which can make it harder to fight off infections. They also found that denser neighborhoods with more people living close together can increase the risk of getting COVID-19, but they can also help reduce the risk of dying from the disease. The study also found that factors like age and race can affect the risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. Overall, the study showed that designing communities that are walkable and have lots of green spaces is important for our health and can help protect us from diseases.
