# __A Continuously Active Antimicrobial Coating effective against Human Coronavirus 229E__

## Summary of the article

There is a coating called SurfaceWise2 that can be put on surfaces to kill viruses. It is being tested to see if it can kill the coronavirus that causes the common cold. Scientists sprayed the coating on stainless steel and then put the virus on it to see what happened. They found that after 10 minutes, more than 90% of the virus was killed, and after two hours, more than 99.99% was killed. This means the coating can help stop the spread of viruses on surfaces. However, this study hasn't been checked by other scientists yet, so we need to wait for more research before we know for sure.

## Short summary of the article

A novel continuously active antimicrobial coating called SurfaceWise2™ was tested for its efficacy against human coronavirus 229E, a common cold virus. The coated surfaces, supplied by Allied BioScience, were prepared by applying a quaternary ammonium polymer coating to stainless steel coupons. The coating thickness was monitored to ensure even application. The test virus was propagated and assayed in the MRC-5 cell line after three freeze-thaw cycles. The viral stocks were then aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The performance of the antimicrobial coating was assessed using the ASTM Method E1153, modified to evaluate the efficacy against human coronavirus 229E. Coated stainless steel coupons were incubated with the virus for a contact time of 120 minutes. The viruses were neutralized and extracted from the surface, and the virus titer was determined by plating on MRC-5 monolayers. The antiviral efficacy of SurfaceWise2™ was also evaluated in liquid form using the ASTM E1052 Standard Test Method. The results showed a reduction of the virus by more than 90% within ten minutes and by more than 99.99% within two hours. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of SurfaceWise2™ in inactivating human coronavirus 229E on surfaces, suggesting its potential for reducing the spread of respiratory viruses in various settings. However, it should be noted that this research has not undergone peer review and should not inform clinical practice.
