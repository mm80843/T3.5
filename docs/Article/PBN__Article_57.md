# __Study of COVID-19 pandemic in London (UK) from urban context__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.cities.2020.102928

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that investigated the transmission of COVID-19 in London and four other cities in the UK (Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield) from an urban perspective. The study analyzed the relationship between climatic factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and the number of COVID-19 cases in London. The results showed a moderate negative correlation between temperature and the number of new cases and deaths. However, the correlation between climatic factors and COVID-19 cases varied depending on the time period analyzed. The study also examined the impact of distance from London on COVID-19 transmission in the other cities, finding that as the distance increased, the number of cases decreased. The research highlights the importance of urban context and policy in limiting transmission, particularly in densely populated cities. The study concludes that climatic factors may not be a significant factor in COVID-19 transmission, and that social distancing and urban policy are crucial in preventing the spread of the virus.

## Summary of the article

The text is about the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, specifically in London and other cities in the UK. It talks about the climate and how it may or may not affect the transmission of the virus. Researchers looked at temperature and humidity, but they found that there was not a strong correlation between the weather and the number of COVID-19 cases. They also studied the distance between London and other cities and found that as the distance increased, the number of cases decreased. The text also mentions the importance of social distancing and staying away from crowded areas to prevent the spread of the virus. It concludes that urban policies should be put in place to stop the spread of the virus in cities.
