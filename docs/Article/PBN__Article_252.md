## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that examined the use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a tool for detecting and monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The study estimated the amount of SARS-CoV-2 present in wastewater and its detectability using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that WBE could detect the virus at concentrations as low as 10 RNA genomes per milliliter of sewage, making it a practical and cost-effective method for population-wide surveillance compared to individual clinical testing. However, the study also highlighted the importance of considering wastewater temperature, as it can impact the persistence and detection of the virus. The researchers conducted simulation models to determine the effects of temperature on the detectability of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. They found that seasonal temperature changes can have a significant influence on virus detectability, especially in areas with longer in-sewer travel times. The study concluded that WBE, when combined with clinical testing, could provide valuable data for public health responses and save billions of dollars in economic and social burdens. The researchers estimated that approximately 2.1 billion people globally could be monitored using WBE in existing sewage treatment plants. However, they also noted that further experiments and data are needed to improve the accuracy of detection and to establish the presence of intact, infective virus particles in sewage. Overall, this study highlights the potential of WBE as a powerful tool for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and informing public health interventions.

## Summary of the article

Scientists have found that wastewater can be used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. They estimated that one infected person can be detected among a group of 100 to 2,000,000 people through wastewater analysis. Temperature and the time it takes for wastewater to travel through the sewer system can affect the ability to detect the virus. They also found that globally, about 2.1 billion people could be monitored through wastewater analysis in sewage treatment plants. Using wastewater-based epidemiology along with clinical testing could save a lot of money.
