# __Green spaces, especially forest, linked to lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates: A one-year nationwide study__

## Summary of the article

Green spaces, like parks and forests, have many health benefits for people. They can help reduce stress, improve physical health, and make people feel happier. Some studies have looked at whether being near green spaces can also lower the risk of getting infected with the coronavirus. Two recent studies suggest that green spaces might provide some protection against the virus. They found that areas with more green spaces had lower infection rates. This study wanted to know if those findings still held true during the later waves of the pandemic. They found that being near forests, in particular, was associated with lower infection rates. They also found that the optimal distance to get the most benefits from forest exposure was within a 12.5-17.5 minute walking distance. This study shows that green spaces, especially forests, can help protect us from the virus by reducing the risk of getting infected.

## Short summary of the article

This study examines the relationship between green spaces, particularly forests, and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The researchers conducted a comprehensive assessment of the association between green spaces and infection rates in 3,108 counties in the United States from January to December 2020. They found that green spaces, especially forests, have a significant negative association with SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. The effect was strongest in counties with moderate levels of urbanicity. The association between forest and infection rates increased over time, with the strongest effect observed in the most recent time period when infection rates were at their highest. The study also identified an optimal buffer distance of 1.0-1.4 kilometers from forested areas, within which the greatest reduction in infection rates was observed. The findings suggest that preserving and developing green spaces, particularly forests, may help reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
