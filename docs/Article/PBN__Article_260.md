## Short summary of the article

This study investigates the energy consumption patterns and behaviors of occupants in Kuwaiti residences. It aims to provide accurate quantitative data that can be used in thermal simulation programs to improve the accuracy of results and inform energy conservation efforts. The study collected data from 30 randomly selected houses, representing different cultural and economic strata in Kuwait. The results showed that the average number of occupants in a Kuwaiti household is seven, with a significant proportion of youth and a relatively young and active population. The residences in Kuwait have a large number of rooms, indicating affluence and the ownership of a variety of electrical appliances. The study also examined the activity patterns and schedules of occupants, as well as the operation schedules of electric lights and appliances. The results showed that occupants tend to leave lights on even when rooms are unoccupied and that television watching is a common social habit in Kuwait. The study also analyzed the use of air conditioning and found that most rooms are air-conditioned all day long, with an average thermostat setting of 21.79°C. Simulation analysis using the data gathered from the survey showed that using Kuwaiti values instead of default values in thermal simulation software increased energy consumption by 21%. The study concluded that occupants' lifestyle and behaviors significantly impact energy consumption and that efforts should be made to raise awareness and promote energy-saving habits among Kuwaiti residents.

## Summary of the article

In Kuwait, people use a lot of electricity. This is because they have big houses with many rooms and lots of electrical appliances like TVs and computers. The people in Kuwait also like to keep the lights on even when they are not using the rooms. They set the air conditioning to a low temperature, which uses a lot of energy. This is because electricity is very cheap in Kuwait. The government has tried to tell people to save energy, but it hasn't worked very well. If people in Kuwait start turning off the lights and setting the air conditioning to a higher temperature, they could save a lot of money and energy.
