# __Addressing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on energy use in municipal buildings: A case study in Florianópolis, Brazil__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the energy consumption of municipal buildings in Florianópolis, Brazil. The analysis focused on administrative buildings, elementary schools, and nursery schools, which experienced a significant reduction in energy use during the lockdown. However, the study found that these buildings still consumed a considerable amount of energy, suggesting a portion of energy use not directly related to occupant presence. The analysis also identified a basal energy use intensity in these buildings, representing the minimum energy required to maintain minimal operation. The study identified the main causes of remaining energy consumption, including stand-by loads, vital loads, and sporadic activity of staff. The findings highlight the need for strategies to reduce energy wastage in buildings and promote energy efficiency in the post-pandemic scenario. The study suggests that changes in building operation, maintenance, and organizational culture can help reduce the basal energy consumption. Implementing energy efficiency measures and understanding the primary factors that influence building energy use are essential for achieving sustainable energy transitions.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many buildings were not being used but still used a lot of energy. The study focused on municipal buildings in Florianópolis, Brazil and found that even though the buildings were nearly empty, they still consumed a lot of electricity. The researchers found that some buildings had a "basal energy use intensity," which means they used energy even when no one was there. This could be because of things like appliances left on standby, lights left on for safety, or vital systems that needed to be running. The study suggests that buildings need to be more energy efficient and policies should be put in place to reduce wasted energy.
