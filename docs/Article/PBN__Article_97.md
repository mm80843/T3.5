# __Impacts of COVID-19 on residential building energy use and performance__

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many changes in people's daily lives. Many schools had to close and students had to do their schooling at home using computers or tablets. Lots of people had to work from home instead of going to their offices. This meant that people were using more electricity at home. The pandemic also changed when people used electricity the most. For example, during the day when people would normally be at school or work, there was an increase in electricity use. People also used more appliances, like kitchen appliances, and spent more time on their computers and streaming videos. The pandemic also affected how much people used their heating and cooling systems. Overall, the pandemic has changed how and when people use electricity in their homes.

## Short summary of the article

This research study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residential electricity consumption in the United States. The study uses measured, high-frequency, disaggregated residential electricity consumption data from 225 housing units primarily located in Austin, Texas. The data is divided into three categories: HVAC loads, non-HVAC loads, and overall loads. The analysis reveals that there was an increase in total daily non-HVAC loads during the pandemic, indicating that occupants increased their use of appliances and other plug-loads while staying at home. The data also shows that HVAC loads increased in 2020 compared to 2018, indicating a higher use of HVAC systems under equivalent weather conditions. The analysis further examines the impact on different income groups and finds that lower-income groups and higher-income groups experienced the largest percent increases in non-HVAC loads. The study emphasizes the need to reconsider assumptions about residential energy use and highlights the importance of understanding the changes in energy consumption behavior during and after the pandemic.
