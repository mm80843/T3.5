This study looked at why the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the United States more than other countries, even though it has a smaller population. The researchers found that there are many differences between the states within the U.S., including how they approach COVID-19 mitigation strategies and how well the public complies with these strategies. The researchers built a model to understand how these factors affect the spread of the virus. They found that when states have stricter mitigation measures in place and the public complies with them, the virus spreads less. They also created a visual tool to help policymakers make decisions about COVID-19 restrictions. The researchers hope that this study will help in the fight against the pandemic.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research study investigates the relationship between mitigation strategies and compliance in reducing the spread of COVID-19 infections at the state level in the United States. The study uses an epidemiological model that incorporates community mitigation strategies, as measured by the Bentley State Stringency Index (BSI), and compliance by the public, measured by a Compliance Indicator (CI). The model is applied to six U.S. states and simulations are conducted to understand the interaction between the BSI, CI, and the basic reproductive number (R0), which represents the average number of people an infectious person will infect. The results show that the BSI and CI both play a crucial role in reducing the transmission of the virus, but compliance by the public is particularly important. The simulations demonstrate the minimum levels of compliance needed to control the epidemic given a particular level of stringency. The study also compares the Bentley Stringency Index with the Oxford Stringency Index and finds that the Bentley Index is more conservative and provides a better fit with the observed data. The research concludes by suggesting a practical tool that combines the BSI and CI to guide public policy decisions and enhance public compliance. The study acknowledges limitations in the data quality and the under-reporting of cases, but highlights the importance of considering both mitigation measures and compliance in the fight against the pandemic.
