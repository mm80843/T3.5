# __The importance of vector control for the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases__

## DOI of the article

10.1371/journal.pntd.0007831

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the history of vector control for vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as malaria, dengue, Chagas disease, and onchocerciasis. The abstract highlights the importance of vector control in preventing the transmission of VBDs, particularly in areas where multiple VBDs are co-endemic. The abstract emphasizes that vector control plays a crucial role in reducing the global burden of VBDs and explains the different methods used in vector control, including chemical-based and non-chemical-based tools. The abstract also discusses the effectiveness of past vector control interventions and the importance of sustained investment and political commitment to ensure successful control of VBDs. Furthermore, the abstract calls for the development and implementation of new vector control tools and strategies to combat the challenges posed by insecticide resistance and environmental changes. Overall, the abstract concludes that the lessons learned from the history of vector control can inform and shape future efforts to reduce the burden of VBDs.

## Summary of the article

Vector-borne diseases are infections spread by bugs like mosquitoes and ticks. Some common vector-borne diseases include dengue fever, malaria, and yellow fever. These diseases mostly affect people in tropical and subtropical regions. Vector control is an important way to prevent these diseases. It involves using different tools and methods to reduce or eliminate contact between bugs and humans. Some tools include insecticide-treated bed nets, insecticide spraying, and larvicides. It's important to invest in vector control and continue to find new ways to prevent these diseases.
