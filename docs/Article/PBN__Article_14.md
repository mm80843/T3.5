## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a perspectives piece that explores how the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the politics of sustainable energy transitions. The authors discuss the impact of the pandemic on various aspects including energy system change, finance and investment, multi-scalar governance, and social practices. They note that the pandemic has led to a significant reduction in energy demand and prices for fossil fuels, while renewable energy demand remains less affected. There is potential for a shift towards green recovery packages and increased investment in sustainable energy, as well as a reevaluation of financial practices that support fossil fuel industries. The authors also highlight the role of national governments and sub-national actors in responding to the crisis and shaping energy governance. They emphasize the need to consider the social and political practices that may change as a result of the pandemic and how public support for climate action may evolve. Ultimately, the authors argue that the decisions made during the recovery from the pandemic will be crucial in determining the success of sustainable energy transitions.

## Summary of the article

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a big impact on the world. Many people have gotten sick and some have died because of the virus. We have also had to stay at home and not go to school or see our friends. The pandemic has also affected the global economy and the way we use energy. Because of the lockdown measures, there was a big decrease in the use of fossil fuels like oil, which made the air cleaner. On the other hand, renewable energy like solar and wind power was not affected as much. Now, people are thinking about how we can recover from the pandemic in a way that helps the environment and reduces climate change. There is a big opportunity to invest in sustainable energy and create jobs while also protecting our planet. It's important for governments and people to make choices that will help us have a better future.
