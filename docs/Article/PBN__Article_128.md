## Short summary of the article

This study investigates the literature and presents a systematic approach for conducting a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) in health club facilities, using a case study in Saudi Arabia. The research focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic and the precautionary measures that can be implemented in health clubs to limit the spread of the virus. The study includes a literature review of previous POE studies in health club facilities and identifies the gaps in the research. The research methodology involves a review of international and contextual literature, followed by a walkthrough evaluation of a case study health club facility. The study aims to answer several research questions related to the management and operation of health club facilities during the pandemic. The findings of the study include recommendations for improving the facility management, such as implementing better ventilation systems, increasing the availability of hand sanitizers, and improving the spatial configuration of equipment. The study concludes by highlighting the importance of POE in health club facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of members during the pandemic.

## Summary of the article

This research is about health club facilities and how they have had to make changes because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health club facilities are places where people go to exercise, relax, and socialize. Because of the pandemic, health clubs had to close for a few months and then reopen with new safety measures in place. Some of these measures include temperature checks, wearing masks, and keeping equipment and spaces clean. The researchers studied one health club facility in Saudi Arabia and found that there are still some improvements that can be made to keep everyone safe. Some recommendations they made include improving ventilation, adding more hand sanitizers, and rearranging equipment to allow for more distance between users. Overall, health clubs are working hard to make sure that people can stay healthy and safe during the pandemic.
