This research abstract summarizes a study on the use of ultrabrief psychological interventions (UBPI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. UBPI training was introduced in Universiti Malaysia Sabah in 2018 and has been used in various psychiatric settings. UBPI incorporates techniques from evidence-based psychological interventions and allows for quick psychological interventions to be performed by healthcare professionals. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, UBPI was modified and compiled into a manual called UBPI for COVID-19 (UC-19). The UC-19 manual was created in Malay to reach as many users in Malaysia as possible. The study discusses the use of UC-19 in two scenarios: occupational mental health and psychological first aid (PFA) for the public. Positive feedback has been received from practitioners and users of UC-19, and it has been adapted for telepsychiatry consultations and used in a web chat portal. The study highlights the potential for UBPI to be widely adopted in healthcare and emphasizes the need for further quantitative evidence.

Ultra Brief Psychological Interventions for COVID-19 Pandemic: Introduction of a Locally-Adapted Brief Intervention for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Service

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a special kind of therapy called ultrabrief psychological interventions (UBPI) was created to help people with their mental health. It was made into a book called the UC-19 manual, which can be used by doctors and nurses to help their patients. The UBPI techniques are short and practical, and they can be done in less than 15 minutes. The manual was also translated into Malay so that more people in Malaysia can use it. UBPI has been used by nurses and on a web chat platform to help people who are feeling anxious or distressed because of the pandemic. There is still more research needed to see how well UBPI works, but so far, people have given positive feedback about it.
