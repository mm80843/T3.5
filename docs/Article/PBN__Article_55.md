This study aimed to monitor hospital environmental hygiene and evaluate the quality of infection control in isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in the isolation wards of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in China. The hospital implemented routine cleaning and disinfection procedures, and samples were collected from environmental surfaces, sewage, and staff personal protective equipment (PPE). None of the environmental surface samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, indicating the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection measures. Three sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection equipment tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but subsequent samples from the outlet and final outlet of the disinfection pool were negative. All staff respiratory specimens tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The study also found that the respiratory and stool samples of two patients with COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting potential transmission routes. However, the object surfaces surrounding these patients tested negative for the virus, indicating the effectiveness of disinfection measures. Overall, the study demonstrates that strict disinfection and hand hygiene practices can help reduce the risk of hospital-associated COVID-19 infections in isolation wards.

A new virus called SARS-CoV-2, which causes a disease called COVID-19, has spread all around the world. The virus can be transmitted through close contact with infected people and droplets from their sneezes or coughs. It's important to keep hospitals clean during the outbreak to prevent the spread of the virus. Researchers in China studied the hospital environment and found that surfaces in the isolation wards where COVID-19 patients are treated were clean and did not have the virus on them. The staff in the wards also had clean personal protective equipment and did not have the virus in their respiratory samples. However, they found traces of the virus in the sewage, which means that it can be present in the waste from infected patients. Overall, the study showed that if hospitals follow strict cleaning and hygiene measures, the risk of infections can be reduced.
