The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on sustainable buildings and cities. The virus spreads rapidly in indoor environments, making proper ventilation and filtration systems crucial to reduce infection risk. However, most existing HVAC systems are not designed for the level of filtration needed to control the virus, leading to extensive retrofits and increased energy consumption. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for rethinking how we control indoor air quality, especially in cold climate environments where energy is primarily used for heating. Personalized indoor controls at the room level and patient scale are being explored to meet the demands of healthcare facilities. 

While outdoor air quality has improved during the pandemic due to reduced economic activities, climate change remains a concern. Heat events and the interaction between extreme heat and ozone pose risks to urban environments and vulnerable populations. The pandemic has also caused shifts in energy demands for the building sector, with increased energy consumption in residential buildings and decreased energy needs for commercial buildings. Continuous monitoring of energy demands and adapting built environment designs based on occupant behaviors are necessary. 

The pandemic has exacerbated social equity issues related to indoor environments, as people are forced to spend more time indoors without adequate HVAC systems. Low-income communities face the economic burden of using HVAC systems during the summer season. As extended stay-at-home periods continue, sociotechnical analysis and solutions are needed to address the challenges of climate change, vulnerable communities, and global pandemics.

The COVID19 pandemic has affected many parts of our lives, including buildings and cities. Buildings are important because the virus can spread easily indoors, so it's important to have good ventilation and filters to control the spread. However, many buildings were not designed with this in mind, so changes may need to be made to make them safer. The pandemic has also affected the demand for energy, with less energy being used in commercial buildings and more in residential buildings. This has led to changes in how buildings should be designed in the future. Lastly, the pandemic has shown that not everyone has access to healthy indoor environments, which is a problem that needs to be addressed.
