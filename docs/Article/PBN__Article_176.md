# __Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Indonesian residents regarding COVID-19: A national cross-sectional survey__

## Summary of the article

In summary, this study looked at what Indonesian residents know about COVID-19, how they feel about it, and what they do to prevent it. They found that most people have good knowledge about the virus and have positive attitudes towards preventing it. They also found that women tend to have higher levels of knowledge and better practices compared to men. However, some groups, like people in Kalimantan and Papua, those with less education, the unemployed, and single people, may have lower levels of knowledge and less safe practices. The government should provide more education and support to these groups to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of Indonesian residents towards COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 8 to June 30, 2020, using online methods to collect data. The study included 3,464 participants, predominantly women and well-educated individuals. The majority of participants demonstrated good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices in preventing and mitigating the spread of COVID-19. However, there were some gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices among certain groups, including men, residents in Kalimantan and Papua, those with lower education levels, the unemployed, and those who were single or never married. The study highlights the need for targeted health education programs to improve knowledge, attitudes, and practices among these groups. Overall, the findings provide valuable information for policymakers and public health officials in managing the COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia.
