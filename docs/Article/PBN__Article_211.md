Biophilic design is a way of bringing nature into buildings to make people feel happier and healthier. Architects use different strategies, such as adding plants, natural light, and water features, and using natural materials to create a connection with nature. Biophilic design can help protect the environment and make buildings more sustainable. It can also improve people's well-being and make them more productive. However, it's important to carefully plan and maintain these natural elements in buildings to ensure they have a positive impact. There is still a lot of research to be done to understand the best ways to use biophilic design and measure its effectiveness.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This review explores the concept of biophilic design in architecture, which aims to integrate nature into buildings to promote sustainability and well-being. The study examines the origins of biophilic design in environmental psychology and its definition in architecture. It compares different frameworks and taxonomies of biophilic design elements and identifies three key design approaches and eighteen primary elements. The review also investigates how biophilic design can contribute to sustainable architecture by addressing specific challenges, such as climate change, air pollution, and health issues. The study provides design strategies and examples for implementing biophilic design in architecture and suggests a biophilic design framework for guiding future research and practice. Overall, biophilic design offers a way to reconnect with nature and enhance the sustainability and well-being of built environments.
