## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that explores the influences of social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study investigates the impact of social media use in various dimensions, including public awareness, fake news, knowledge sharing, and psychological well-being and anxiety. The research was conducted online during the lockdown in Cyprus, and the respondents were asked to participate voluntarily. The findings reveal that social media is used as the primary medium for information retrieval during the pandemic, and users are aware of the spread of fake news and rely on official organizations for accurate information. The study also shows that social media use does not create panic or anxiety among users during the pandemic. Additionally, decision-makers are influenced by social media discussions, and users do not use social media for support during this time. Recommendations are made for health ministries and content developers to use social media effectively in providing accurate information and support during pandemics. The study concludes that social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic is different from normal times, with a focus on survival and collective goals. The study has limitations, such as a limited sample size and the need for further research on the recognition of fake news and the social media use of recovered cases.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been using social media more than usual. They use it to get information about the virus and to stay connected with friends and family. Social media can be a good way to learn about the virus, but there is also a lot of fake news. People need to be careful and check if the information is true before sharing it. Social media has also been affecting people's mental health. Some people feel anxious because of all the information they see online. But others feel stronger and more informed because of social media. Overall, social media use during COVID-19 is different than normal times, but it can be helpful if used responsibly.
