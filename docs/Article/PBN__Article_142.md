# __Sustainability of Coronavirus on Different Surfaces__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.jceh.2020.04.020

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study on the transmission and sustainability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus is believed to have originated from bats and was transmitted to humans through palm civets. Factors contributing to the increase of the pandemic include large human population gatherings and human intervention that has disrupted ecosystems globally. The virus can be transmitted through close contact, touch, and airborne droplets. It can survive for varying durations on different surfaces such as metal, plastic, and cardboard. Disinfectants play a critical role in killing microorganisms and are commonly used in hospitals and other settings. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have similar sustaining times on different surfaces, with a linear decrease in infection capability over time. Alcohol-based disinfectants are effective in reducing the survival and decay time of the virus. Overall, the study provides insights into the transmission and sustainability of the coronavirus on various surfaces.

## Summary of the article

A virus called COVID-19 has been spreading all over the world. It started from bats and then passed to humans through another animal called palm civets. The virus can spread between people when they get close to each other or touch things that have the virus on them. It can stay on surfaces like metal and plastic for a long time. Disinfectants, like alcohol, can kill the virus and help keep us safe. We need to be careful and clean our hands and things we touch to protect ourselves from getting sick.
