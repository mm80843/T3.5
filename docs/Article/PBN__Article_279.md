In this article, the authors discuss how the design of high-rise apartment buildings can be improved to promote the well-being and health of the residents, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. They talk about the importance of having windows with good views of nature, as this can help people feel calmer and happier. They also suggest creating different spaces within the apartment that can be used for different activities, like working or exercising. It's also important to have bedrooms that are designed for restful sleep, with windows that can be closed for darkness at night. The authors also mention the need for shared spaces in the building that allow for physical distancing and social interactions. Finally, they discuss the importance of natural ventilation and access to nature, like balconies, in promoting well-being.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on high-rise apartment housing and the importance of implementing restorative environmental design principles to improve resident well-being and health. The abstract highlights the increased amount of time people are spending in their homes and the need for residential design to prioritize occupant comfort and quality of life. It explores various aspects of apartment housing design, including window views, spatial variety, privacy, adaptable floor plans, circadian regulation in bedrooms, restorative spaces for positive social interactions, natural ventilation, thermal comfort, connection to nature, and appropriate unit sizes and layouts that support physical distancing. The abstract provides evidence from various studies and literature reviews to support the importance of these design considerations and offers recommendations for implementing restorative design principles in apartment housing. It also emphasizes the need for resilience in apartment design to address future pandemics and societal changes.
