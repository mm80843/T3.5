# __SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: potential health risk, but also data source__

## Short summary of the article

This study reports the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples collected at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and near the first Dutch cases in Tilburg, Netherlands. The presence of viral RNA in the wastewater samples was observed within a few days after the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in the country. This suggests that wastewater could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and early warning tool for the presence of the virus in the population. It is not yet known if the virus found in wastewater is viable and capable of fecal-oral transmission, but evidence suggests potential community spread. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has implications for those working with sewage and highlights the importance of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene practices in preventing infectious diseases. Additionally, the study highlights the potential of wastewater surveillance as a source of data, particularly in areas with limited diagnostic capacity. The study also discusses the emerging evidence of enteric involvement in COVID-19 patients, with gastrointestinal symptoms being reported in a multicenter study in China. Further research is needed to better understand the extent of enteric involvement in COVID-19 and its implications for patient care.

## Summary of the article

Scientists have found the virus that causes COVID-19 in wastewater. This means that by testing wastewater, they can see if the virus is spreading in a community before people even show symptoms. This could help them give early warnings and stop the virus from spreading more. They have also found that the virus can be in poop and might be able to spread through people's poop. So it's important to have good sanitation to keep everyone safe. Scientists are still learning more about how the virus spreads, but this new discovery could help keep us safe from COVID-19.
