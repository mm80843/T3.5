# __Building sustainable finance for resilient protected and conserved areas: lessons from COVID-19__

## Short summary of the article

This paper examines the state of finance for protected and conserved areas (PCAs) before the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impacts of the pandemic on PCA finance. Before the pandemic, PCAs faced significant funding challenges, with the global protected area network receiving only one-third of the necessary funding for effective management. Funding shortfalls were particularly pronounced in the Global South, with funding gaps of 25 to 300 percent in Southeast Asian PCAs and unmet budget requirements in North American PCAs. The global calls to increase the area of land and sea under protection will further increase funding needs, with estimates ranging from $103-178 billion annually. The composition and stability of funding sources were also a concern, with many PCAs relying on a narrow financing base. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate these financial challenges, with potential reductions in tourism revenue, domestic public budgets, and international development aid. However, there are opportunities to rebuild sustainable financing for resilient PCAs by diversifying the funding base, improving spending effectiveness and efficiency, ensuring domestic budgets support PCAs, increasing international development finance and philanthropy, strengthening revenue generation from tourism, supporting PCAs governed by Indigenous peoples and local communities, including local communities in PCA governance and benefits, engaging the finance sector and attracting private capital, and raising public support and interest in nature conservation and PCAs. These recommendations provide a strategic approach to addressing the financial constraints and challenges faced by PCAs.

## Summary of the article

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, protected and conserved areas (PCAs) were already facing challenges in getting enough funding for their management. Only about one-third of the funding needed was being provided, and many PCAs did not have enough staff or money for effective conservation. This problem was especially pronounced in the Global South, where there were funding gaps of up to 300%. The pandemic has made this situation worse, as tourism, which is a major source of funding for PCAs, has been greatly affected. Funding from governments and philanthropy is also at risk because of the economic crisis. To address these challenges, there are recommendations to diversify funding sources, improve spending efficiency, increase domestic and international financing, strengthen revenue from tourism, support PCAs managed by local communities, involve local communities in governance and benefits, engage the finance sector, and raise public support for nature conservation and PCAs.
