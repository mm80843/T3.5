## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to examine the incidence and predictors of decreasing interest and avoidance of COVID-19 news. An online survey was conducted, and participants were asked about their interest, avoidance, demographic variables, health status, and mental health symptoms. The results showed that one-third of the respondents were losing interest or avoiding news about COVID-19, and 26% had stopped following the news. Younger age, post-traumatic stress symptoms, less fear of COVID-19, and less frequent use of healthcare professionals for information were associated with decreasing interest and avoidance of news. More frequent use of friends/relatives for information and less frequent use of internet news sources were also associated with avoidance or diminishing interest in COVID-19 news. It is important to maintain public interest and awareness about the pandemic to optimize adherence to public health measures. Younger individuals should especially maintain interest in COVID-19 news. Strategies should be implemented to decrease the burden of negative and distressing information and to use healthcare professionals as reliable sources of information. Further studies should explore the association between interest in COVID-19 news and adherence to public health measures.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that started in China and has spread all over the world. It has caused a lot of problems for people's health and for the economy. To control the spread of the virus, people have to do things like social distancing and wearing masks. But sometimes, all the news about COVID-19 can be overwhelming and make us lose interest or want to avoid it. This study looked at why some people are losing interest in the news and avoiding it. They found that younger people, people with more stress, and people who don't fear COVID-19 as much are more likely to lose interest or avoid the news. They also found that getting information from friends and family instead of healthcare professionals or the internet can make people lose interest. It's important to keep people interested and informed about COVID-19 so they can stay safe and follow the rules to stop the spread of the virus.
