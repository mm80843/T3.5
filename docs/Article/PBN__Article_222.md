## Summary of the article

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a big impact on people's health and the economy around the world. People with existing health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure are more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19. The measures to stop the spread of the virus, like staying at home and closing schools, can make it harder for people to stay healthy and get the care they need. This is especially true for children in poor countries. There is also a concern that the pandemic will make people more likely to be malnourished, which can lead to serious health problems. The pandemic has also disrupted education and made it harder for families to afford healthy food. It's important for governments and organizations to take action to help people stay healthy and well-nourished during this time.

## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the nutrition and health of women and children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Response measures such as self-isolation and lockdowns have led to poor management of risk factors for undernutrition, limited access to preventive care, and reduced access to fresh and nutritious foods. The economic impact of the pandemic has further exacerbated the problem, pushing vulnerable households into poverty and limiting their access to healthcare and social safety nets. The interruption of education has also affected nutrition programs and access to health and nutrition education. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of safe and healthy household environments, including access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene. To address these challenges, countries need to prioritize social protection programs, ensure access to healthcare, leverage community health workers and support groups for education and outreach, and focus on creating safe and healthy environments. It is essential to make evidence-informed and data-driven decisions to protect the health and nutrition of vulnerable populations and prevent the reversal of progress in reducing undernutrition.
