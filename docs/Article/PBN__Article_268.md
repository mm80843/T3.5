# __Strategies to Mitigate COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on Health and Safety of Workers in Construction Projects__

## DOI of the article

10.36937/cebel.2021.002.001

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and safety of construction workers in the construction industry. It highlights the rapid spread and long incubation period of the virus, as well as the decline in travel and implementation of social distancing measures. The pandemic has led to significant declines and losses in transport operations and has impacted workers in the transportation sector. The study emphasizes the need to understand the complex decisions that affect the construction system during a pandemic. It compares COVID-19 to past epidemics and highlights the unique challenges it presents. The abstract also explores the socio-economic-environmental impacts of the pandemic on construction and provides a ten-point strategy to reduce its impact on the health of construction workers. It discusses the disruption of construction activity, the severe impact on taxes and other fees, and the positive and negative environmental impacts of the pandemic. The abstract concludes with limitations of the study and recommendations for future research.

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It has spread all over the world and has caused many people to get sick and even die. The pandemic has affected many areas, including the construction industry. Workers in construction have had to take extra precautions to stay safe, like wearing masks and staying far apart from each other. The pandemic has also impacted the economy, with less money coming in and some construction projects being delayed or put on hold. However, there have been some positive effects on the environment, like less pollution from cars. It is important for everyone, including construction workers, to take care of their health and follow safety guidelines during this time.
