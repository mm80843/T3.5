The coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It has spread all over the world and has caused many people to get sick and even die. The pandemic has affected many areas, including the construction industry. Workers in construction have had to take extra precautions to stay safe, like wearing masks and staying far apart from each other. The pandemic has also impacted the economy, with less money coming in and some construction projects being delayed or put on hold. However, there have been some positive effects on the environment, like less pollution from cars. It is important for everyone, including construction workers, to take care of their health and follow safety guidelines during this time.
