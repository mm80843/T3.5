# __The Smart City and Covid‐19__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This editorial provides an overview of how the Covid-19 pandemic is impacting and shaping smart city technologies. With major cities under lockdown, smart city technologies focused on efficiency and traffic management are no longer a priority. Instead, cities are focusing on enforcing lockdown measures, promoting social distancing, and ensuring the availability of essential supplies. The deployment of smart city technologies is expected to be delayed until some level of normality is restored, which may take several months or even years, especially if many workers continue to work from home. The pandemic has also led to increased surveillance and monitoring of individuals, with governments using mobile phone tracking to track the spread of the virus and enforce self-isolation. While such surveillance raises civil-liberty concerns, it also opens up possibilities for data provision into smart cities to optimize transport, reduce crime, and understand people's movement during unusual situations. However, careful consideration of personal data security and sharing is essential to avoid abuse. Smart city technologies can also play a significant role in healthcare by tracking patient numbers, predicting hospital capacity, and optimizing supply chains for essential medical equipment. In the long term, cities may experience changes such as restrictions on crowding in public transport, a decrease in office workers, increased sanitation monitoring, and the development of well-documented procedures to respond to future pandemics.

## Summary of the article

The Covid-19 virus is affecting cities all over the world. Many cities are in lockdown, which means that streets are empty and shops and restaurants are closed. Smart city technologies that help with things like traffic and efficiency are not as important right now. Instead, cities are focused on enforcing lockdown, making sure people stay apart from each other, and making sure everyone has enough food and medicine. Some cities are using mobile phones to track people to see if they have the virus or if they have been near someone who has it. This can help them make decisions to keep people safe. It is important to protect people's privacy when using this kind of technology. Smart city technology can also help hospitals by tracking how many patients they have and making sure they have enough supplies. In the future, cities may have new rules to prevent crowded public transportation and to make sure people stay healthy. They will also have plans in place to deal with a future pandemic.
