This scoping review investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The review highlights the potential of AI-driven tools in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medical treatments, including faster identification of cases, positioning of patients for radiological imaging, and data mining for exploratory analysis. AI can also be used in COVID-19 screening, contact tracing, and diagnosis, with applications such as chest CT scanning, identification of high-risk groups, and prediction of new infections. AI is also being utilized in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients and in drug development, such as predicting the risk of mortality and discovering potential treatments. The review emphasizes the opportunities for Low-Middle Income Countries (LMIC) to adapt and implement AI-driven tools to mitigate the burden on their healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes. Overall, AI shows great potential in various aspects of the COVID-19 response and has the ability to transform healthcare systems globally.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that can help us fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. It can use algorithms to quickly and accurately identify cases of the virus, which can help doctors treat patients faster. AI can also help track the spread of the virus and predict where future outbreaks might happen. It can even help scientists develop new drugs to fight the virus. However, AI is mostly being used in wealthier countries, and there is a need to use AI in poorer countries to help them fight the pandemic too. AI has the potential to make healthcare better and more efficient for everyone.
