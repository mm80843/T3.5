## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research article investigates the potential use of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a method to disinfect the air and reduce transmission of COVID-19. UV-C light at wavelengths close to 254 nm is used to create an irradiation field that disinfects airborne bacteria and viruses. The study uses a decay equation to describe the viral inactivation achieved by a given UV radiant flux. The researchers conducted a literature review to gather data on the UV irradiation of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. They found that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to UV-C damage and more vulnerable to UV inactivation than other coronaviruses. The study also estimates the required upper-room UV irradiation flux and effective upper-room Z value for SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that upper-room UVGI has the potential to effectively disinfect SARS-CoV-2 in the air, especially when combined with good room air mixing and ventilation. However, further experimental work is needed to validate the results and assess the limitations of upper-room UVGI in real-world scenarios.

Researchers have been studying the use of ultraviolet (UV) light to disinfect air, equipment, and blood plasma in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19. One method that has been used is called upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). This method uses UV-C light at a certain wavelength to kill bacteria and viruses in the air. UV-C light can be harmful to humans, so there are safety measures in place to protect people from direct exposure. Upper-room UVGI has been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of diseases like measles and tuberculosis. However, it has not been proven yet if it can kill the COVID-19 virus. Researchers are trying to figure out how much UV light is needed to kill the virus and if upper-room UVGI can be used as a way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in buildings.
