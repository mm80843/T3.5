This research paper focuses on the challenges faced by the construction and transportation sector during the COVID-19 pandemic and the strategies that can effectively address them. The study conducted an extensive literature review to identify these challenges and management strategies.

The paper suggests various strategies to overcome these challenges, including redefining job site safety by implementing social distancing, health checks, and disinfection measures, increasing the use of technology for remote work and virtual meetings, extending project timelines, offering flexible work schedules, recognizing stress symptoms, providing employee training, and maintaining effective communication. These strategies aim to ensure the health and safety of the workforce and support their well-being during the pandemic. The findings of this study can assist project managers, contractors, and subcontractors in managing their projects successfully during these challenging times.
