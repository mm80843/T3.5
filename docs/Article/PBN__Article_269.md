A machine called the Surfacide uses ultraviolet light to kill viruses and bacteria on surfaces. It has three big lights that rotate to shine light all around a room. Scientists tested the Surfacide on two viruses called MHV-A59 and MERS-CoV. They put the viruses on glass and then exposed them to the UV light for different amounts of time. After just a few minutes, the viruses were gone and couldn't make people sick anymore. This is important because it means the Surfacide machine could help keep hospitals clean and stop the spread of viruses.

This research study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Surfacide multiple-emitter automated UV-C disinfection system against MHV-A59, a mouse analog of MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The system consists of three UV-C emitters with touch screen control and motion sensors. The study found that the UV-C energy emitted from the Surfacide system was able to reduce the viral titers of MHV-A59 by an average of 2.71 log10 in 5 minutes and 6.11 log10 in 10 minutes of exposure. This resulted in undetectable levels of the virus. For MERS-CoV, a 5-minute exposure to the UV-C emitter resulted in undetectable virus levels that remained undetectable even after 30 minutes of total exposure. The study also emphasized that UV-C disinfection should be used as an adjunct to standard cleaning practices, rather than a replacement. This research is the first to document the effectiveness of a whole-room UV-C system against RNA viruses like MHV-A59, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The use of the Surfacide system during MERS outbreaks can potentially prevent the nosocomial spread of the virus and protect staff.
