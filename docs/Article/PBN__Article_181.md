## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a systematic review of the literature on the effects of quarantine and social distancing on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found that the quarantine period resulted in anxiety, stress, and depression in individuals, independent of geographical location. Factors contributing to these mental health problems included limited information about COVID-19, media influences, and increased perception of harm. The prevalence of mental health symptoms is higher in areas with a higher number of infected individuals. Certain factors like gender, having COVID-19 symptoms, being a student, and poor perceived health were associated with higher anxiety and depression levels. Younger individuals, especially those with enhanced access to social media and those affected by the new online education environment, were found to be more vulnerable to mental health issues. Sleep quality was negatively impacted during the outbreak. The review also explored the potential positive effects of being physically active during quarantine and social isolation. Home-based exercises and activities such as exergames, dancing, and yoga were found to have positive effects on anxiety and mood, cognitive performance, mental health-related quality of life, and depressive symptoms. The World Health Organization provided recommendations for staying active in and around the home, including climbing stairs, increasing household chores, joining online physical activity classes, and performing muscular strengthening exercises. Overall, the review suggests that being physically active during quarantine and social isolation can help reduce the negative psychological impact of these measures. However, more research is needed to better understand the effects of physical activity during the pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have to stay at home and can't go out and play with their friends. This can make people feel stressed, anxious, and sad. But there are ways to feel better even if we have to stay at home. We can do exercises at home like dancing, yoga, and other activities that make our bodies move. These exercises can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. We can also play video games that make us move around, like dancing and sports games. Listening to music while exercising can also make us feel happier. It's important to stay active and not sit or lie down all day. Even if we can't go outside, we can still do fun exercises at home to stay healthy and happy.
