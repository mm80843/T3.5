During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing became very important to stop the spread of the virus. Retail stores had to use signs to tell people how to practice social distancing inside their stores. At first, they used simple signs printed on regular paper, but later they started using professional signs with their logos and colors. The signs told people to stay apart from each other and to wear masks. Some signs also showed how many customers were allowed in the store at a time. The signs helped people understand the new rules and stay safe.

This study explores the use of retail store signs to communicate and reinforce social distancing behavior during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto, Canada. The study collected data through photographs of exterior and interior signs within a two and a half kilometer radius of the researcher's home. Findings reveal that in the early stages of the pandemic, retailers primarily used informal signs printed on standard printer paper, often with small fonts and black ink. As the situation progressed, retailers began to replace informal signs with professional signs that were larger, more visually appealing, and used brand colors and fonts. Multi-location retailers had an advantage in developing and implementing signage due to their resources and expertise. The study suggests that retailers' use of signage during the pandemic can be seen as evidence of corporate social responsibility and as an important way to create awareness and reinforce new social distancing norms. Limitations of the research include the limited geographic area studied and the lack of input from retailers and customers. Future research could explore the subjective properties of signs and their impact on brand image, as well as the use of digital signs in crisis communication.
