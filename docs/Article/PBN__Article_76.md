## Summary of the article

Significant progress has been made in reducing the number of people affected by malaria worldwide. Many countries are now working towards completely eliminating malaria. One way to do this is by creating maps that show where the risk of getting malaria is high. These maps can help health programs know where to focus their efforts. In this study, phone data was used to understand how people move around and how this can impact the spread of malaria. By combining this information with the risk maps, they were able to identify areas where the risk of getting malaria is high and where it is being spread to. This can help make better plans to prevent and treat malaria in these areas.

## Short summary of the article

This study explores the integration of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) with case-based risk mapping to support malaria elimination planning in low transmission settings. The study uses data from Namibia, a country that is working towards malaria elimination by 2020. The researchers collected data on malaria cases and their locations, and used regression tree classification and Random Forest modeling to create high resolution risk maps. They also obtained CDRs from a mobile phone service provider, which provided information on human movement patterns. The results showed that the integration of CDRs with case-based risk mapping can provide valuable information on connectivity and movement patterns, which are crucial for designing effective elimination strategies. The study highlights the importance of targeting interventions in high-risk areas and managing the risk of importation from other areas. Overall, this approach can help guide resource allocation and surveillance efforts in malaria elimination programs.
