# __Effects of temperature and humidity on the spread of COVID-19: A systematic review__

## DOI of the article

10.1371/journal.pone.0238339

## Short summary of the article

Respiratory tract infections, including the recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, have significant impacts on global health and economies. This systematic review analyzed the association between weather factors, such as temperature and humidity, and the spread of COVID-19. Seventeen articles were included in the review, all of which were retrospective observational studies. The majority of the studies found that cool and dry conditions were associated with increased transmission of the virus, while warmer and wetter climates were associated with reduced transmission. However, the level of evidence was classified as low due to the observational design of the studies and the potential for bias. Factors such as population density, public health policies, and social behavior also play important roles in the spread of COVID-19. It is important to consider these factors alongside weather conditions when developing public health interventions to control the incidence and spread of the virus. Future research should further investigate the complex interactions between weather factors, social factors, and disease transmission.

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, is a new virus that causes a respiratory infection. It has spread to many countries around the world. Scientists have been studying how the weather, like temperature and humidity, might affect how the virus spreads. They have found that warmer and wetter climates seem to have less transmission of the virus. However, other factors like population density and public health policies also play a big role in how the virus spreads. It's important for governments to have plans in place to control the spread of the virus, especially in cold and dry weather.
