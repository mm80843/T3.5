# __Coronavirus disease 2019: The harms of exaggerated information and non‐evidence‐based measures__

## Summary of the article

There is a lot of information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic going around, but not all of it is true or helpful. Some people spread fake news, which can cause confusion and harm. Scientists have also made mistakes, like publishing flawed papers or making exaggerated estimates. Some estimates said that 40%-70% of people in the world would get infected, but these numbers were probably too high. The same goes for estimates of the death rate. Some extreme measures, like lockdowns, can also have negative effects on the economy and people's lives. It's important to be careful about the information we believe and make sure it's based on real evidence.

## Short summary of the article

This editorial highlights the harms of exaggerated information and non-evidence-based measures surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors discuss several examples of false claims and withdrawn papers that have fueled conspiracy theories and misinformation. They also highlight the exaggerated estimates of the global population that will be infected and the variation in early estimates of the basic reproduction number, which have led to differing expectations on the effectiveness of containment measures. The authors argue that early reported case fatality rate figures are also likely to be exaggerated, as they do not account for undetected infections and the age dependence of CFR. They caution against the misallocation of resources and the implementation of extreme measures without sufficient evidence, as these actions can cause major harm. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is also discussed, as well as the need to learn from COVID-19 and be better prepared for future outbreaks. Overall, the authors emphasize the importance of accurate evidence and open data sharing to effectively handle the pandemic.
