# __Home garden use during COVID-19: Associations with physical and mental wellbeing in older adults__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This study investigated the impact of home green space on physical and mental well-being in older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland. The study used data from the longitudinal Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study and an online survey conducted during the lockdown period. The results showed that spending more time in the garden during lockdown was associated with better self-reported physical health, emotional and mental well-being, and sleep quality. Gardening activities and using the garden for relaxation did not show significant associations with health outcomes. The study also found a positive link between increased garden usage and overall well-being as measured by a composite health score. These findings suggest that access to a garden may have important benefits for the well-being of older adults during periods of prolonged home confinement. The study highlights the need for further research on the role of domestic gardens in promoting health and well-being, especially among vulnerable populations.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people had to stay at home and couldn't go to parks or other green spaces. This affected their mental and physical health. But a study found that older adults who had access to a garden during lockdown felt better. They reported better physical health, emotional and mental wellbeing, and sleep quality. Spending time in a garden can provide exercise, fresh air, and sunshine, which are good for our health. It can also help us feel more relaxed and connected to nature. So, having a garden at home can be really helpful, especially during difficult times like a pandemic.
