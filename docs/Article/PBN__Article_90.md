This research article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's behavior and perceptions of urban green spaces (UGS) in six European countries (Croatia, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Spain). The study finds that the majority of respondents visited UGS frequently prior to the pandemic for physical exercise and relaxation. During the pandemic, there was a significant decrease in UGS visitation in Italy and Spain, likely due to government restrictions. However, many respondents in other countries continued to visit UGS, often at closer distances and by walking. The types of UGS visited also changed, with more visits to urban gardens and green areas outside of towns. The main motivations for visiting UGS during the pandemic included physical exercise, relaxing, and taking the dog out. Overall, respondents missed UGS to a large extent during the pandemic and expressed a desire for more access to green spaces in urban planning. The study highlights the importance of UGS for physical and mental well-being, as well as the need to incorporate green infrastructure into urban design and management strategies.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people were not able to go outside and visit parks and other green spaces as much as they used to. In some countries, like Italy and Spain, many people stopped going to green spaces altogether. But in other countries, like Croatia, Israel, Lithuania, and Slovenia, people continued to visit green spaces even with the restrictions. During this time, people missed being able to go to green spaces and do activities like exercising, relaxing, and spending time with nature. They also realized how important it is to have green spaces in cities, and many people want there to be more green spaces in their neighborhoods.
