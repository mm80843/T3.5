This research paper proposes a method for estimating real-time building occupancy using a people flow model identified through simulation in the software AnyLogic. The method utilizes a Kalman filter and sensor measurements to estimate the number of people in a building. The people flow model is represented as a linear system and the unknown parameters are identified using AnyLogic simulation based on a detailed building layout. Two video cameras and two beam sensors are used as measurement devices to estimate the states of the people flow model. The simulation tests and real people experiments demonstrated that the Kalman filter estimation with the identified model outperforms the sensor-only method in terms of accuracy. The proposed method provides a viable solution for building occupancy estimation in situations where real people flow data is difficult to obtain, especially in mega-tall buildings. Future work includes scaling up the method for large-scale people occupancy estimation in high-rise buildings.

Building occupancy estimation with people flow modeling in AnyLogic

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

This text is about estimating how many people are in a building in real-time. This is important for emergencies and also for things like controlling the heating or deciding when to use elevators. The authors talk about different methods that have been used to estimate occupancy, but they have some problems. So they propose a new method using a computer program called AnyLogic to simulate how people move in a building. They also use cameras and beam sensors to measure how many people are in different areas. They compare their estimated numbers to the real numbers from the cameras, and their method works better than just using the sensors. They also try their method in a real experiment and it works there too. They say that this method could be useful for tall buildings where it is hard to measure how many people are inside.
