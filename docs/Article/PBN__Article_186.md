## Short summary of the article

This research proposes a methodology for the automated optimal design of physical spaces to enable social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology is based on the circle packing problem, where the objective is to arrange objects in a given physical space while adhering to social distancing requirements. The optimization problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved using the interior-point method. The proposed methodology can handle various types of physical spaces, such as rectangular, circular, and triangular rooms, and can incorporate constraints related to the airflow pattern, position of windows and doors, and fixed objects within the space. The methodology is demonstrated through several examples, including meeting rooms, common areas, airplane seating arrangements, and an atrium area of a university building. The results show that the proposed methodology can generate feasible and optimal arrangements of physical spaces that adhere to social distancing requirements. This research provides a novel approach to help designers and decision-makers in planning and reconfiguring physical spaces to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

## Summary of the article

In this article, the authors propose a way to design or reconfigure physical spaces with the appropriate level of safety measures, such as social distancing, in order to minimize the risk of infection. They use a mathematical optimization technique called circle packing to find the best way to arrange objects in a given physical environment. The authors show examples of how this method can be used to design meeting rooms, common areas, seating arrangements, and even airflow patterns in closed environments. They also mention that their proposed methodology can be implemented as a practical tool to help designers and decision makers arrange physical spaces with social distancing measures. Overall, this method can help create safe environments during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
