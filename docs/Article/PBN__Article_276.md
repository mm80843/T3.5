## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban park use patterns in North Carolina, USA. Two data collection methods were used: a survey of residents and cell phone location data. The findings revealed significant declines in urban park visitation since the start of the pandemic, consistent with other studies. The declines in park visitation were more pronounced in socially vulnerable communities, exacerbating preexisting disparities in park use. Higher-income individuals and frequent park users were more likely to increase their park use during the pandemic. The results suggest that the pandemic did not attract many new users to urban parks and highlight the need for more effective communication to underserved populations. The study also found that park use patterns varied based on demographic factors such as income, race/ethnicity, and age. The findings underscore the environmental justice concerns and the need for equitable access to park spaces. Future research should explore the mechanisms behind these disparities and the impact of different public health regulations on park use.

Urban Park Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Socially Vulnerable Communities Disproportionately Impacted?

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people had to stay home and couldn't go to many places they usually went to. But when they were allowed to go outside, they often went to public parks and greenspaces. Parks are good for our health because they help us be active and reduce stress. Some studies have shown that people who went outside more during the pandemic had better health outcomes. However, not everyone had the same access to parks. People in low-income and BIPOC communities often had less access to parks, and they were also less likely to visit parks during the pandemic. This is not fair and shows that some people have more opportunities for good health than others. More research needs to be done to understand and fix these inequalities.
