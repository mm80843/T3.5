# __Global value chains: Efficiency and risks in the context of COVID-19__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This policy brief discusses the costs and benefits of global value chains (GVCs) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The brief identifies potential sources of exposure to shocks in GVCs and uses a global trade model to analyze the consequences of a hypothetical re-localization policy scenario. The results show that while countries may be less exposed to foreign shocks in a re-localized scenario, they would also be less efficient and less able to cushion shocks through trade. The economic case for policy-induced reshoring of GVCs is weak. However, there is scope for international cooperation and governments to work with businesses to improve risk preparedness. The brief provides key policy recommendations, including working jointly with firms to improve risk preparedness, prioritizing shipments of essential goods, calibrating stockpiles of essential goods, reducing unnecessary heterogeneity of standards, and fostering competition and diversification in GVCs. While the policy brief focuses on efficiency and stability, it acknowledges the importance of addressing environmental sustainability and social issues in GVCs. Overall, the brief highlights the benefits of GVCs in cushioning economic shocks and warns against policies that significantly alter the geography of GVCs.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic showed how interconnected countries are through global value chains (GVCs), which are networks where different countries specialize in producing different parts of a product. While GVCs have many economic benefits, like lower prices and increased productivity, there are also risks and instability involved. Some people suggest that countries should "re-localize" GVCs by producing more things domestically to reduce these risks. However, a recent study by the OECD shows that this might not be the best solution. The study found that if countries re-localize GVCs, they would become less efficient and less able to handle shocks. It would also lead to lower levels of economic activity and income. Instead, governments can work with businesses to improve their readiness for shocks and diversify their supply chains to reduce risk.
