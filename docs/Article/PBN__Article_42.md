This research study investigates the association between chronic air pollution exposure and the spread of COVID-19 in China. The study collects COVID-19 infection and fatality data from every prefecture in China, normalizes the data per 10,000 inhabitants, and analyzes the correlations between air pollution, population density, and COVID-19 variables. The results show a positive correlation between high levels of air pollution, particularly pollutants such as CO, HCHO, PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO2, and higher rates of infection, fatalities, and mortality related to COVID-19. The study also reveals that aerosol data from satellites, which potentially include PM 2.5 and PM 10, were not associated with fatalities or mortality rates. The findings align with previous studies conducted in other countries, including the United States, Italy, Iran, France, and the UK, which also found correlations between air pollution and the incidence and severity of COVID-19. The study emphasizes the need for further investigation into the role of air pollution as a cofactor for airborne transmittable diseases and calls for greater attention to be placed on curbing climate change to prevent future epidemics.

COVID-19 Higher Mortality in Chinese Regions With Chronic Exposure to Lower Air Quality

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

This study looked at the connection between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19 in China. The researchers found that areas with higher air pollution had more cases and deaths from the virus. They looked at different types of air pollutants, like carbon monoxide and particulate matter, and found that they were associated with more infections and fatalities. This suggests that air pollution could make people more susceptible to the virus. It's important to take care of our environment and reduce air pollution to protect ourselves from diseases like COVID-19.
