## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that aimed to assess the value and willingness to pay for green roofs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study collected data from 556 respondents from 35 different countries through an online survey. The results showed that the majority of respondents had access to green areas in their home environment, such as balconies, terraces, or gardens, but 27% had no green areas. During the confinement period, respondents realized the value of outdoor space and expressed a desire for a garden. In terms of green roof knowledge, 90% of respondents were familiar with the concept and believed it would be a good idea to have a green roof at home. However, cost and maintenance were identified as barriers to installing green roofs. The study found that 53% of respondents were willing to pay 0.1%-2.5% of their monthly mortgage installment for a medium-sized green roof, while 54% would consider investing in a larger green roof. The factors influencing willingness to pay included household income, interest in access to vegetation, and the perception of green spaces after confinement. The study also found differences in willingness to pay between respondents from Portugal and other countries, suggesting that cultural and socioeconomic factors play a role in value perception. Overall, the study highlights the potential value and demand for green roofs in urban environments.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how people feel about having green spaces, like gardens or green roofs, in their homes, especially after being stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers surveyed over 500 people from different countries to see how much they would be willing to pay for a green roof and what factors influenced their decision. They found that most people valued outdoor space more after the pandemic and would be willing to pay a small percentage of their monthly mortgage payment for a green roof. Factors like income, education level, and the type of housing they grew up in also played a role in their willingness to pay. Overall, having green spaces at home became more important to people during the pandemic.
