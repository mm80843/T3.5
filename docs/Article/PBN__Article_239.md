## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile technology has been used to develop apps that can help monitor people's health and track the spread of the virus. These apps can provide useful information to the government and individuals, and help prevent the further spread of the virus. Mobile technology includes devices like smartphones and tablets that can connect to the internet and share data. These devices are used in apps for things like telemedicine, where patients can consult doctors remotely, and contact tracing, where people can be alerted if they have been in contact with an infected person. However, there are also challenges and limitations to consider, such as privacy concerns and the need for widespread adoption of these apps. Overall, mobile technology has played a significant role in helping manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
