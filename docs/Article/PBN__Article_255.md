This rapid review focuses on investigating the effectiveness of measures to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks in workplace settings. It maps the IPC measures investigated in included studies and assesses COVID-19 positivity estimates associated with these measures. The review found that combined measures were more effective in preventing workplace transmission compared to single measures. Universal asymptomatic testing yielded low positivity rates, but its effectiveness varied depending on the specific implementation strategies. PPE, timely and thorough outbreak investigations and surveillance, and staff compartmentalization within zones were identified as important considerations. Mathematical modeling studies supported the effectiveness of combined IPC measures, including timely contact tracing, case isolation, and the use of PPE. However, the review also identified several research gaps, including the lack of evidence on the effectiveness of worker education, contact tracing methods, and environmental adjustments in preventing workplace transmission. The review emphasizes the need for tailored IPC measures in different workplace contexts and calls for further research to address these gaps and protect workers in various settings.

COVID-19 Prevention and Control Measures in Workplace Settings: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

The COVID-19 pandemic has made workplaces a high-risk environment for spreading the virus. Many workers have gotten sick and it's important to find ways to keep them safe. This study looked at different measures that workplaces can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They found that using multiple measures, like testing employees, contact tracing, wearing masks, and improving ventilation, was more effective than using just one measure. It's also important for workplaces to provide education and training to their employees about staying safe. This study can help guide workplaces on how to protect their workers during the pandemic and in future health emergencies.
