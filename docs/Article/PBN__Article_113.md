This research abstract summarizes a study that investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility behaviors, specifically focusing on public transport users. The study was conducted in the city of Gdańsk, Poland. The findings showed that the pandemic had a significant impact on mobility behaviors, with a decrease in the use of public transport and an increase in the use of private vehicles and active modes of transport. Factors such as fear of infection, switch to online work and learning, and a lack of alternative modes of transport contributed to the decline in public transport use. The study also found that the feeling of comfort and safety in public transport during the pandemic influenced passengers' willingness to return to using public transport after the pandemic. The findings highlight the need for policies and measures that prioritize the safety and comfort of public transport users to encourage their return to using public transport in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on how people travel. Governments have put restrictions in place, like limiting the number of people on buses and trains, to keep everyone safe. As a result, many people have stopped using public transport and instead started using their own cars or bikes. This has made it harder for public transport companies to make money. People are also feeling less safe using public transport because they are worried about getting sick. In a survey, many people said they plan to continue avoiding public transport even after the pandemic is over. It will be important for cities to make public transport safe and comfortable again so that people feel more confident using it in the future.
