## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the role of knowledge translation (KT) platforms in pandemic responses, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a context. KT platforms bring together decision-makers, researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders to translate evidence into policy and action during public health crises. The abstract outlines the emerging roles of KT platforms, including engaging decision-makers in setting priorities, synthesizing the best available evidence, contextualizing and disseminating actionable evidence, promoting trust and countering misinformation, providing platforms for cross-sectoral dialogue, and monitoring and evaluating policy response. The abstract also discusses the lessons learned from a KT platform effort in a middle-income country and highlights the importance of rapid response services, positioning KT platforms as credible sources of evidence, remaining responsive to changing priorities, searching for evidence beyond conventional sources, harnessing complementary evidence networks, and leveraging multiple dissemination channels. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the need to invest in and strengthen KT platforms to support evidence-informed decision-making during public health crises.

Amplifying the role of knowledge translation platforms in the COVID-19 pandemic response

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been really important for decision-makers to use the best research evidence and data to make decisions. But sometimes they didn't use that evidence, and instead made decisions based on other things like politics or money. That's where knowledge translation (KT) platforms come in. These platforms bring together different people like researchers, policymakers, and community groups to make sure that the best evidence is used to make decisions. They help decision-makers set priorities, find and understand the best evidence, and make sure that the evidence is used in the best way. KT platforms can also help to counter fake news and misinformation by being a reliable source of evidence. They can also help different groups work together and share information, and can monitor and evaluate how well policies are working. Overall, KT platforms are really important in times like this to help make sure that decisions are based on the best evidence available.
