The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid spread of misinformation through social media, posing a serious threat to public health. This study aims to understand the individual drivers of COVID-19 misinformation sharing and cyberchondria (excessive health-related anxiety driven by online health searches). The researchers developed and tested a research model using survey data from 294 Facebook users in Bangladesh. The results showed that online information trust and information overload were associated with increased sharing of unverified COVID-19 information and cyberchondria. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility also predicted increased cyberchondria. However, health beliefs did not have an impact on sharing unverified information. Gender had a significant effect, with females experiencing higher levels of cyberchondria and being less likely to share unverified information compared to males. Age moderated the effects of information overload and perceived severity on cyberchondria and sharing unverified information. The findings suggest that interventions to reduce the spread of misinformation and cyberchondria should focus on managing information consumption and verifying sources. Social media platforms and health organizations can play a role by curbing the amount of COVID-19 information and directing users to trusted sources.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a lot of false information being spread on social media. This false information, called misinformation, can be very harmful to our health. It can make people not follow the rules to stay safe, like wearing masks and washing hands, or even believe things that are not true. Some people even attacked cellphone towers because they believed they were causing the virus. The World Health Organization is working hard to stop the spread of misinformation and wants to understand why people share it. They found that when people trust online sources and feel overwhelmed with too much information, they are more likely to share misinformation. They also found that some people worry a lot about their health and spend too much time searching for information online, which is called cyberchondria. This can also make them more likely to share misinformation. It is important for us to be careful about what we believe and share on social media, especially during a global crisis like COVID-19.
