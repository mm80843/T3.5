COVID-19, a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, has spread all over the world and caused a lot of problems. It has affected travel, the economy, and our daily lives. It spreads from person to person through tiny droplets in the air when someone talks, sneezes, or coughs. The virus can also survive on surfaces like tables and doorknobs, and people can get infected if they touch these surfaces and then touch their face. To protect ourselves, we need to wash our hands often, wear masks, and keep a distance from others. In the future, architects and designers will need to think about how to make buildings and homes safer from viruses like COVID-19.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the design of future residential architecture. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs through person-to-person and person-to-surface-to-person contact, with primary infection pathways being the nose, mouth, throat, and eyes. The virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods of time. Therefore, the design of residential structures should incorporate compartments to minimize the likelihood of transmission and create spaces that allow for internal containment and function in a pandemic environment. The abstract suggests the inclusion of delivery spaces, a containment space, a sink for handwashing, and individual filter systems for different areas of the home. It also discusses the need for communal spaces that allow for social distancing and separate areas for self-isolation. The abstract emphasizes the need for retrofitting existing buildings and the consideration of socio-economic factors in housing design to minimize disparities in public health.
