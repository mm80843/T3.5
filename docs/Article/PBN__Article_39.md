This research abstract summarizes two studies. The first study focuses on the distribution and determinants of HIV prevalence in South Africa. The study used the South African Demographic and Health Survey data, which included representative sample surveys of households. The study found that HIV prevalence was 28.4% among women and 14.8% among men. Provincial HIV prevalence varied, with Kwazulu-Natal having the highest prevalence. Certain factors, such as age and marital status, were associated with higher HIV prevalence among women and men. The study also identified hotspots and groups that need targeted preventive and control measures. The second study examined rural disparities in surgery from gynecologic oncologists in the Midwestern United States. The study found that rural women were less likely to receive surgical care from a specialist and to be referred to a specialist compared to urban women. However, there was no significant difference in specialist surgery after a referral. Rural women treated by a specialist had better surgical outcomes, but experienced a longer time from diagnosis to surgery. These findings highlight the need to address disparities in access to specialized care for ovarian cancer in rural areas.

This is a study that looked at HIV prevalence in different provinces in South Africa. They used data from a survey that asked people questions about their health and also encouraged them to get tested for HIV. They found that 28.4% of women and 14.8% of men in South Africa had HIV. The provinces with the highest HIV rates were Kwazulu-Natal and North West. They also found that older women and men living in communities with high poverty rates were more likely to have HIV. This study helps us understand where HIV is most common and who is most affected, which can help us come up with better ways to prevent and control the virus. 

Another study looked at how women in rural areas in the Midwestern part of the United States get surgery for ovarian cancer. They found that women in rural areas were less likely to get surgery from a specialist doctor called a gynecologic oncologist. They were also less likely to be referred to a specialist in the first place. However, when they did get surgery from a specialist, they had better outcomes like more complete tumor removal. This study shows that there are differences in how women in rural and urban areas are treated for ovarian cancer, and more research is needed to figure out why and how to make sure everyone gets the best care possible.
