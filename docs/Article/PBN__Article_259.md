## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes the development and features of a formal ontological model for COVID-19 epidemiology and monitoring. The modeling process followed established principles, including determining the domain and scope of the ontology, reusing existing ontological terms and models, and developing a conceptual model. Core domain knowledge concepts were extracted from various sources, and existing ontologies such as the OBO Foundry and OWL 2 were used to ensure interoperability and enable data sharing. The model was designed to be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and aligned with international data standards. The abstract also mentions the inclusion of additional terms to enhance the ontological coverage of epidemiological surveillance and highlights the use of design patterns for measurements, taxonomic structures, and patient-population linking. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the importance of FAIR data for rapid analysis, evidence-based decision-making, and trust in the context of infectious disease outbreaks. The developed ontology and related resources are publicly available for reproducibility and community re-use.

The COVID-19 epidemiology and monitoring ontology

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

The scientists made a special way of organizing information about COVID-19 called an ontology. They followed some steps like finding important words from other sources and using existing ontologies to help them. They used a special computer language called OWL 2 to make the ontology. They also made sure that the information could be easily found and understood by other scientists. They shared their work with everyone on a website called GitHub.
