The potential roles of robotics in managing public health and infectious diseases, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are becoming increasingly apparent. Robotics can be utilized in four broad areas: clinical care, logistics, reconnaissance, and continuity of work and maintenance of socioeconomic functions. In the context of disease prevention, robot-controlled noncontact ultraviolet (UV) surface disinfection can effectively reduce contamination on high-touch surfaces in hospitals. For diagnosis and screening, mobile robots equipped with thermal sensors and vision algorithms can enhance the efficiency and coverage of temperature measurement. Automated or robot-assisted swabbing can speed up the process of sample collection for diagnostic testing. Robot systems based on ultrasound imaging can automate venepuncture, and drones or ground vehicles can be used for sample transfer and delivery of medicines. Social robots can provide continued social interactions and adherence to treatment regimes during prolonged isolation. Teleoperation technology enables telemedicine and telecommuting, allowing for remote interactions and reducing the need for in-person gatherings. The experiences with the Ebola outbreak have identified various use cases for robotics in infectious disease management. However, sustaining research efforts and fostering collaboration between engineering and infectious disease professionals are necessary to ensure that robotics is prepared for future incidents.

Robots can be really helpful in managing public health and infectious diseases like COVID-19. They can be used in different areas like hospitals and public places. For example, there are robots that can disinfect surfaces using ultraviolet light, which kills the virus. There are also robots that can measure people's temperature to check if they have a fever, which is a symptom of COVID-19. Some robots can even take samples for testing, so that people don't have to do it themselves. Robots can also be used to deliver medicine and interact with people to provide social support. Using robots can help keep people safe and prevent the spread of diseases.
