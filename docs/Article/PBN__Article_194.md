## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of chaos around the world. To stop the spread of the virus, many countries had to close down businesses and people had to stay away from each other. This has had a big impact on the economy and on how people behave. Many small businesses, like restaurants and hotels, have been hit the hardest. To survive this difficult time, entrepreneurs need to be resilient and come up with creative and innovative ideas. The government also plays a role in supporting small businesses. Resilience is important because it helps businesses adapt to changes and find new opportunities. The pandemic has shown that businesses need to be able to change and find new ways of doing things. It's also important for the government to support small businesses and create an environment where they can thrive.
