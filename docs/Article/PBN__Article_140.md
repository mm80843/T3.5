# __The Role of Architecture and Urbanism in Preventing Pandemics__

## DOI of the article

10.5772/intechopen.98294

## Short summary of the article

This chapter explores the role of architecture and urbanism in preventing and mitigating pandemics, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. It discusses the limitations of the contemporary healthcare system in responding to pandemics, highlighting the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions in early pandemic stages. The chapter also examines the historical role of the built environment in combating pandemics before the advent of antibiotics, including measures such as isolation, quarantine, and architectural and urban considerations for air quality and sunlight. It discusses the One Health system response to pandemics and the role of the built environment in this approach. The chapter further explores the impact of pandemics on the healthcare system and the economy, emphasizing the need for a reevaluation of future strategies. It discusses the certification of health-engaged architecture and urbanism, as well as the warnings about future pandemics that have been issued in recent decades. The chapter then reviews the scientific findings during the COVID-19 pandemic that have implications for the design of the built environment, such as the impact of pollution, the importance of green areas, and the role of urban population density. It examines the architectural and urban measures that can be taken to mitigate pandemics, including air control, medium-density residential designs, public space considerations, and improvements in transportation. The chapter concludes by considering the opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to reshape architecture and urbanism, and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary strategies and public and political engagement in combating future pandemics.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, architecture and urbanism have played an important role in preventing and mitigating the spread of the virus. In the past, buildings and urban planning were used to fight diseases like tuberculosis and the plague. But with the discovery of antibiotics, medicine took over as the main strategy. However, the COVID-19 pandemic showed that the healthcare system was not prepared, and non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing and wearing masks became important again.

Architecture and urbanism can contribute to preventing and mitigating future pandemics. Studies have shown that air pollution can increase the spread of the virus, so improving air quality in buildings is important. Green spaces like parks have also been found to have a positive impact on public health. Building designs can also encourage social distancing and reduce the density of people in certain areas. 

In addition, transportation systems can be redesigned to reduce the spread of the virus. This includes promoting walking, biking, and shared mobility options, as well as using technology like robo-taxis. 

Overall, by incorporating these measures into architecture and urban planning, we can better prepare for and respond to future pandemics. It is important for scientists, architects, and policymakers to work together to create strategies that prioritize public health and well-being.
