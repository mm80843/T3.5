This research paper focuses on the importance of green space quality in urban planning for sustainable development. The integration of green infrastructure into urban areas has been recognized as a strategy to create livable and biodiversity-friendly cities. However, the mental health benefits of green spaces and their impact on wildlife support are often overlooked in urban planning. This paper aims to review existing evidence on the relationship between green space quality and mental health and wildlife support, compile a list of indicators used in these studies, identify potential synergies and trade-offs between the two dimensions, and propose a framework based on the One Health approach to uncover interlinkages in the context of urban green spaces. The study conducted a systematic review of articles related to green space quality, mental health, and wildlife support. The findings suggest that green space attributes such as spatial configuration, vegetation structure, design, management, acoustic environment, and biodiversity can affect mental health outcomes and wildlife support in urban green spaces. Some indicators that promote synergies between mental health and wildlife support include peri-urban locations, large patch areas, presence of water bodies, grass and bush cover, tree cover, plant richness, moderately enclosed vegetation, habitat diversity, and low ambient noise levels. However, trade-offs may occur in terms of perceived safety, attractiveness, and human aesthetic preferences on one hand and wildlife requirements on the other hand. The study emphasizes the need for more holistic approaches and interdisciplinary research to inform urban planning and design for multifunctional green spaces that benefit both humans and wildlife. The proposed framework based on the One Health approach can guide the development of inclusive and biodiverse cities.

In the future, there will be more people living in cities, so we need to make sure our cities are healthy and good for the environment. One way to do this is by having green spaces in the cities, like parks and gardens. Green spaces are good for our mental health and for supporting wildlife. They can help us feel less stressed and happier. They can also provide a home for animals that can live in cities. However, green spaces need to be good quality to be beneficial. We need to make sure they are well-designed, well-maintained, and have a variety of plants and animals. By doing this, we can have cities that are good for people and good for nature.
