In December 2019, a new virus called COVID-19 started spreading in a city called Wuhan in China. This virus is called a coronavirus and it can make people sick. There were some problems with how the government in Wuhan communicated about the risk of the virus. They didn't make good decisions at first and they didn't give all the information to the public. This made it harder for people to know how to stay safe. It's important for the government to be honest and tell people the truth about the virus. They should also listen to experts and make decisions based on what they say. Good communication can help stop the virus from spreading.
