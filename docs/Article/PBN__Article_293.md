# __Perception of COVID-19 impacts on the construction industry over time__

## DOI of the article

10.1080/23311916.2022.2044575

## Short summary of the article

This study examines the perceptions of construction professionals in the United States and Iran regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the construction industry. The study is conducted in three rounds of surveys, six months apart, to understand how these perceptions have changed over time. The study population comprises construction professionals in both countries, and a total of 567 responses are collected. The findings show that both groups perceived a relatively high impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of their professional careers. However, this perceived impact lessened over time. The study also highlights the differences and similarities in perceptions between the two countries. The researchers suggest that the results can help construction managers and policymakers in adopting global approaches and localizing response plans. The study acknowledges its limitations, including the sample size and response intervals, and suggests further research to explore the change in perceptions over time among construction professionals.

## Summary of the article

This text is about a study that was conducted to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the construction industry. The researchers surveyed construction professionals in the United States and Iran at three different points in time to see how their perceptions changed over time. The study found that both groups of professionals believed that the pandemic had a significant impact on various aspects of the construction industry. However, over time, their perceptions of the impact lessened. The study also found that professionals in stronger economies felt more prepared to handle the impact of the pandemic. Overall, the study helps construction managers and policymakers understand how professionals perceive the impact of COVID-19 and can help them make better plans.
