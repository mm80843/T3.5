# __Pandemic Analytics: How Countries are Leveraging Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence to Fight COVID-19?__

## DOI of the article

10.1007/s42979-021-00923-y

## Short summary of the article

This study examines the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. Various countries and organizations have implemented these technologies to address different aspects of the pandemic, such as early detection, contact tracing, monitoring compliance with lockdown measures, predicting disease spread, and identifying potential treatments. Examples include Canada-based company BlueDot alerting clients about the outbreak in Wuhan before the WHO, China using movement data and creating heat maps to track the spread of the virus, the UK's NHS partnering with tech companies to build a digital platform for real-time insights and recommendations, and the US using data analytics and AI to provide real-time information and support decision-making. Some challenges and limitations of these approaches include the lack of historical data, interoperability issues, data sharing barriers, data quality concerns, and privacy and security risks. Overall, big data analytics and AI have proven to be valuable tools in addressing the COVID-19 crisis by providing insights, guiding decision-making, and facilitating better management of healthcare resources.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and organizations around the world are using big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to help manage the crisis. These technologies can analyze large amounts of data to track the spread of the virus, predict where it might spread next, and help hospitals plan for the number of patients they might need to treat. For example, some companies in China created heat maps and used movement data to track the flow of people and understand how the virus was spreading. In Taiwan, they used big data analytics to create a detailed map of people's travel histories and symptoms to help identify potential cases. Other countries like the UK, the US, and Singapore have also used big data and AI for contact tracing, testing, and monitoring compliance with lockdown rules. These technologies have proven to be valuable tools in the fight against COVID-19 by providing important insights and helping to make better decisions.
