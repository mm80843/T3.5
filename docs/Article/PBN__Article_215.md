## Short summary of the article

This research paper provides a review of the experiences and lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, focusing on the systemic gaps and risks revealed and the opportunity for resilience building in the face of pandemics and climate change. The paper highlights how the pandemic exposed the fragility of various sectors of the economy and interrelationships across human lives, as well as the potential complexity humans could face if climate change is not addressed. It discusses the gaps in healthcare, surveillance and monitoring, societal and socio-economic aspects, the digital divide and information gap, and capacity and resilience across industries and organizations. The paper emphasizes the need to build resilience by enhancing well-being and promoting inclusiveness, and provides practical steps for building back better, including improving supply chain resilience, prioritizing the furthest behind, promoting diversified growth and innovation hubs, reorienting priorities towards inclusive and sustainable development, developing agile and responsive institutions, and investing in preparedness. The paper highlights the importance of integrating national, state, and local plans through capable institutions to align strategies and resources for achieving set priorities. Overall, the paper emphasizes the need to learn from the pandemic and address the systemic gaps and risks to build resilience for future emergencies and climate change.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have both caused big problems around the world. During the pandemic, many businesses had to close, and people lost their jobs. This made it hard for some families to survive. Climate change has also caused a lot of problems, like droughts and extreme weather. It has even made some animals and plants disappear. Both the pandemic and climate change have shown us that we need to be better prepared for these kinds of emergencies. We need to improve our healthcare systems, protect the environment, and make sure everyone has access to education and support. We also need to share accurate information and work together to find solutions. By learning from the pandemic, we can build a better world that is ready for future emergencies and the challenges of climate change.
