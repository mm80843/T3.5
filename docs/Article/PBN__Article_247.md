## Summary of the article

During the lockdown, when people had to stay at home, there were a lot less cars on the road and noise levels outside went down. But inside people's homes, there was more noise from things like neighbors and construction. People complained about noise more on social media during the lockdown. A survey showed that people thought outdoor noise went down during the lockdown, but they heard more noise from neighbors. Overall, people were more annoyed by neighbor noise than outdoor noise during the lockdown. This information can help make cities quieter and more comfortable for people to live in.

## Short summary of the article

This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on noise levels and people's attitudes towards outdoor and neighbour noise in London. Social media data analysis revealed an increase in tweets about noise complaints during the lockdown, particularly for neighbour noise sources. Construction/building/machinery and bird noises were the most frequently mentioned sources. The questionnaire survey showed that perceived outdoor noise levels decreased during the lockdown, with transportation noises being less annoying. However, perceived neighbour noise levels increased, with talking/shouting and TV/music being the most annoying sources. Flat dwellers reported higher annoyance ratings for neighbour noise compared to those in houses. Overall, neighbour noise was more annoying than outdoor noise during the lockdown. These findings have implications for urban sustainability and the need for sound insulation guidelines in residential buildings. It is important to consider acoustic comfort in cities and optimize the soundscapes for a sustainable future.
