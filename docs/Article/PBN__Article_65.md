## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that examines the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing transmission of COVID-19. The study uses epidemiological modeling to assess the impact of different interventions on reducing peak healthcare demand and deaths. The results suggest that a combination of interventions, such as home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of household members, and social distancing of high-risk individuals, could reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half. However, even with these measures, hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming of healthcare systems are still predicted. The study also explores two strategies: mitigation, which aims to reduce the health impact of the epidemic while allowing transmission to continue, and suppression, which aims to reduce case numbers to low levels. It concludes that suppression is the preferred policy option, as mitigation alone is unlikely to protect those at risk and prevent overwhelming of healthcare systems. To achieve suppression, a combination of social distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and school closures may be necessary. These measures would need to be maintained until a vaccine is available, which could be 18 months or more. The study also suggests that intermittent social distancing may be possible in the short term, but measures would need to be reintroduced if cases rebound. The study emphasizes the challenges and uncertainties associated with implementing and maintaining these interventions, and the need for ongoing surveillance and adaptation of policies.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic is a very serious health threat around the world. It is caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. There are two strategies that countries can use to fight the virus: mitigation and suppression. Mitigation aims to slow down the spread of the virus but not completely stop it. Suppression, on the other hand, aims to stop the virus from spreading altogether and reduce the number of cases to low levels.

In order to achieve suppression, countries need to implement several measures such as social distancing, staying at home if you have symptoms, and closing schools and universities. These measures need to be in place for a long time, possibly 18 months or more, until a vaccine for the virus is available. Mitigation strategies, which are less strict, can help reduce the impact of the virus but may still result in a large number of cases and deaths.

The effectiveness of these strategies also depends on how people respond to them and how well they are implemented. It is important for governments and communities to work together to follow the guidelines and protect themselves and others from the virus.
