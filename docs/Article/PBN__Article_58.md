# __COVID-19: IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS__

## Summary of the article

The covid-19 pandemic has caused a lot of problems all over the world. It has affected the economy, the health system, and even our ability to get food. The pandemic has made it harder for people to work and earn money, leading to more poverty. It has also made it harder for people to get food because of closed borders and markets. The pandemic has put a lot of pressure on our health system and made it harder for people to get the care they need. It has also made it harder for kids to go to school and get a good education. The pandemic has shown us that we need to work together and find sustainable solutions for the future. We need to protect the environment, make sure everyone has access to clean water and sanitation, and work towards reducing inequality. It is important to include young people and women in these efforts and to use technology and innovation to find solutions. We also need to make sure we have strong partnerships between countries and organizations to achieve these goals.

## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The pandemic has led to an economic crisis and has pushed back progress on goals such as eradicating poverty, zero hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, and climate action. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for partnerships and solidarity between countries and different stakeholders to achieve the SDGs. Initiatives are being developed to address the impact of the pandemic, such as innovative forms of solidarity and humanitarian efforts. To achieve the SDGs, there is a need to incorporate scientific advice, use technology and innovation, strengthen planning mechanisms, include young people and women in initiatives, and protect the environment. The pandemic has also shown the need for a more sustainable and responsible approach to economic development and partnerships. The post-pandemic reconstruction should focus on digital transition, protecting computer systems and databases, developing financial services, and promoting virtual banking and mobile banking.
