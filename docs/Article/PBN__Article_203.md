## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This paper presents the results of a survey conducted in the city of Krakow, Poland to assess the impact of visits to urban green spaces on the mental and physical well-being of residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that before the pandemic, 92% of respondents visited green spaces, but this fell to 78.9% during the pandemic due to mobility restrictions. Compliance with governmental restrictions and fear of infection were the main reasons for not visiting green spaces. However, visiting green spaces during the pandemic was found to have a significant positive impact on respondents' general well-being and stress levels, with over 75% indicating a big or very big influence. The most popular green spaces visited during the pandemic were the Vistula Promenades and the Planty Gardens, which are situated in the city center and offer a combination of natural and historic features. The study underscores the importance of urban green spaces for meeting the intangible needs of residents during a crisis and advocates for their protection and further development.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a new form of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged and spread around the world. This led to many countries implementing social restrictions like lockdowns and closing public spaces, including parks and green spaces. These restrictions had a negative impact on people's physical and mental health. However, studies have shown that being in nature and visiting urban green spaces can actually improve our well-being. In a survey conducted in Kraków, Poland, it was found that visits to urban green spaces during the pandemic had a positive impact on people's mental and physical health. The most popular green spaces visited were the Vistula Promenades and the Planty Gardens. The results of this study can help decision-makers understand the importance of green spaces and encourage the planning and development of more green areas in cities.
