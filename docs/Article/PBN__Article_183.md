## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes the findings from various sources on the current experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article highlights the approaches taken by different countries, such as Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, which relied on extensive testing, honest reporting, and community cooperation rather than solely relying on tracking applications. It also emphasizes the importance of community-centered care rather than patient-centered care in future pandemics, as advocated by healthcare professionals from the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy. The article discusses the increase in knowledge sharing, information gathering tools, and community collaborative intelligence observed in Portugal and other places. It argues for the need to move towards smarter communities that can adapt to new circumstances, utilize current data availability and computational power, and effectively respond to a variety of living requirements. The importance of early alert systems, monitoring the interface between human and animal species, and enhancing collaborative intelligence is also highlighted. The abstract further explores the potential opportunities for change as strict stay-at-home policies are lifted and recommends person-centered integrated care, improved working conditions for healthcare professionals, and the adoption of wellbeing economies and budgets. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for forward-looking approaches and the importance of learning from pandemic experiences to better prepare for future crises.

## Summary of the article

During the coronavirus pandemic, different countries have tried different strategies to deal with the virus. Some countries, like Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, used tracking apps to monitor people's movements and behaviors. But they also focused on testing, being honest about reporting cases, and getting the community to work together. In Hong Kong, they learned a lot from a previous epidemic called SARS. They became more concerned about cleanliness, understood the importance of keeping distance from others, and started to trust and cooperate with each other. In Italy, doctors realized that the way healthcare is usually done is not enough during a pandemic. They called for a new approach that takes care of the whole community and has a plan for future outbreaks. In Portugal, people have been sharing a lot of information and working together to find solutions. It's important that communities learn from these experiences and become smarter in how they deal with health crises in the future.
