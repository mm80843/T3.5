# __10 Adaptive Measures for Public Places to face the COVID 19 Pandemic Outbreak__

## DOI of the article

10.1111/ciso.12282

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses ten adaptive measures for managing public places during a pandemic outbreak. The first measure suggests limiting access nodes to public places in order to better monitor human circulation. It also emphasizes the importance of providing a visible and easily manageable primary access node. The second measure proposes implementing one-way mobility circulation in public places to determine effects on mobility and other behaviors associated with their use. Checkpoint allocation is recommended in the third measure to monitor and record mobility in and out of public places for prevention and safety checks. The fourth measure focuses on making social spaces safe and viable through regular disinfection, high-level hygiene, and waste management. The fifth measure highlights the potential of transforming public places into informative nodes to disseminate relevant information to the public. The sixth measure suggests utilizing flexible public places to support essential sectors such as food distribution or temporary healthcare services. The seventh measure recommends restricting shared facilities and uses in public places to minimize the spread of disease. The eighth measure suggests the closure of secondary public places until the recovery stage to reduce pressure on non-essential services and facilities. The ninth measure proposes the provision of community-level designated zones in higher risk areas for essential services and supplies. Lastly, the tenth measure emphasizes the importance of temporary regulations to monitor and restrict certain activities in public places, such as group gatherings and overcrowded events. Overall, the adaptive measures outlined in this abstract aim to ensure the safety and viability of public places during a pandemic outbreak.

## Summary of the article

During the pandemic, there are some things we can do to make public places safer. One idea is to limit the number of entrances and exits to better control the flow of people. Another idea is to have one-way paths so people don't have to walk past each other closely. We can also have checkpoints to check people's temperatures and keep track of who is coming in and out. It's also important to clean and disinfect public places regularly. Finally, some non-essential public places might need to be closed for a while to keep everyone safe.
