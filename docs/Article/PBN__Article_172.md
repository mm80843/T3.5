# __How to Make Green Building Certification \& Rating Systems More Pandemic-Sustainable?__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research study assesses the need for global green building certification and rating systems (GBC&RS) to implement indicators that make them more sustainable during pandemics. The study focuses on four major GBC&RS: LEED, WELL, BREEAM, and CASBEE. A gap analysis is conducted to identify the missing indicators in each system. The analysis reveals that LEED has the highest gap level at 68%, followed by CASBEE at 54%, BREEAM at 40%, and WELL at 67%. The study suggests specific actions to close the identified gaps in each system, such as implementing touchless technologies, improving wastewater management, and promoting outdoor spaces in buildings. The limitations of the study include the consideration of a limited number of certification systems and a focus on environmental and social sustainability pillars only. Future work should focus on improving existing systems and developing new certifications that address pandemic-related issues more comprehensively.

## Summary of the article

The construction industry pollutes the environment a lot. So, it's important for builders to make sustainable decisions. There are special codes and certifications that help assess how "green" a building is. These certifications make sure buildings use less energy, produce less waste, and don't pollute the air. This study looked at different certifications from around the world and found some gaps in how they address pandemics. They suggested some changes, like using touchless technology and having outdoor spaces, to make buildings safer during a pandemic. The study also pointed out that homes are important places where we work, study, and live, so they need to be sustainable too.
