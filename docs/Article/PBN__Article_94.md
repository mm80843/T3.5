The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of changes in our lives. It's a new virus that can make people sick and it first started in China. Since then, it has spread all over the world and affected many people's health and the economy. The virus spreads easily in buildings and places with lots of people. So, it's important for architects and engineers to design buildings that can prevent the spread of the virus. They need to think about things like good ventilation, using natural light, and having barriers to limit contact between people. We also need to make sure buildings have good sanitation, like clean water and wastewater management. And it's important to have good ventilation to reduce the risk of infection. The pandemic has made us realize how important it is to have healthy buildings that can keep us safe.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on building design and strategies for sustainable building practices. The study utilizes a literature review method to gather information from various sources. The spread of COVID-19 is prevalent in buildings and transportation, with transmission occurring in small, poorly ventilated spaces with large crowds and close contact. The pandemic has led to activities in buildings being limited or suspended, as well as the implementation of measures such as transparent barriers, working hour adjustments, and visitor restrictions. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of healthy buildings and the link between the indoor environment and health. Sanitation and ventilation improvements are crucial in preventing the transmission of the virus in buildings. The pandemic has also influenced interior adaptation, with an emphasis on flexible and adaptable spaces for work, study, and other activities. The study concludes that building design must consider the implications of the pandemic and prioritize the health and well-being of occupants in a post-pandemic society.
