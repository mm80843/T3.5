## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes the guidelines and recommendations made by various HVAC-related institutions and societies regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in buildings. It emphasizes the importance of proper ventilation and airflow patterns in mitigating the airborne transmission of the virus. The guidelines suggest increasing the amount of outdoor air, improving filtration with MERV-13 filters, and using portable room air cleaners with HEPA filters. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is also recommended in high-risk spaces. The guidelines advise keeping HVAC systems running longer and operating them with caution to reduce the risk of transmission. Temperature and humidity setpoints should be considered, and the operation of heat recovery equipment should be monitored. The guidelines also recommend maintaining pressure differentials between zones, inspecting and replacing filters regularly, and ensuring proper water and drainage system maintenance. Overall, the guidelines aim to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through effective HVAC system management. Further research is needed to better understand the transmission routes and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to be careful about how we use HVAC systems, which are responsible for maintaining the air quality in buildings. Poor ventilation can increase the transmission of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Studies have shown that the coronavirus can be detected in the air, and it is possible for it to spread through air conditioning systems. Therefore, it is important to use HVAC systems correctly to reduce the risk of transmission. Some guidelines have been issued by different organizations, like ASHRAE and REHVA, to help people understand how to operate HVAC systems safely during the pandemic. These guidelines recommend increasing the amount of outdoor air, improving air filtration, and running the systems for longer hours. They also suggest using air cleaners with HEPA filters and considering the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. It is also important to maintain proper temperature and humidity levels in buildings. Overall, these guidelines aim to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of the virus and keep indoor environments safe.
