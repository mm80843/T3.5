## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. To tackle this crisis, healthcare systems have needed to quickly adapt in three main areas: triaging and treating a large number of patients, protecting healthcare workers, and shielding vulnerable populations. As a result, digital health has played a vital role in implementing successful strategies. Digital communication strategies have emerged, with platforms like WhatsApp and Slack being used for organizing services and managing staff in the face of high levels of sickness or self-isolation. Social media has also become an important tool for professional communication among healthcare professionals. Digital educational initiatives have been essential to rapidly educate healthcare workers on managing COVID-19, with virtual assessments and e-learning packages being utilized. Patient management has seen the most significant transformation, with telemedicine consultations being implemented to protect vulnerable patients and maintain social distancing. Electronic health records providers and NHS Trusts have rapidly rolled out digital tools and packages to facilitate remote consultations. This shift towards digital health practices must be sustained to strengthen healthcare systems and ensure preparedness for future crises.
