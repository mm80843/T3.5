## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the importance of properly disinfecting and disposing of hospital wastes and wastewater, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals are sources of pollutants from diagnostic, laboratory, and research activities, as well as from patients' medication excretion. Improper disposal of infectious hospital wastes and wastewater can lead to serious risks to public health and the environment. The abstract also summarizes the different disinfection technologies used for hospital wastewater, such as ozone, ultraviolet irradiation, liquid chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sodium hypochlorite disinfection. Each technology has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of technology depends on factors such as waste amount, safety conditions, and operation costs. The abstract also discusses the disinfection technologies for different types of hospital wastes, including incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection. Recommendations are provided for disinfection of hospital wastes and wastewater during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the need for proper disinfection and disposal practices.

Hospitals produce a lot of different types of waste, including pollutants from medicine and chemicals. This waste can be dangerous to public health and the environment if not disposed of properly. A new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and hospitals are treating a lot of infected patients. It's important to properly disinfect the waste and wastewater from these hospitals to prevent the virus from spreading. There are different disinfection technologies that can be used, like ozone, ultraviolet light, chlorine, and steam. The choice of technology depends on factors like cost, amount of waste, and safety. Proper disinfection will help keep people safe and stop the spread of the virus.
