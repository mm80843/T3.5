This research abstract summarizes a study that addresses the need for new assessment tools to evaluate the sustainability of residential buildings under pandemic conditions. The study finds that existing green building certification systems do not cover the necessary indicators for pandemic resilience. As a result, the study proposes a new methodology that includes specific measures for health and safety, mental health, air quality, water quality, environmental resource consumption, and comfort. These measures aim to prevent virus propagation, promote well-being, and ensure the efficient use of resources during a pandemic. The proposed methodology provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and improving the sustainability of residential buildings in the face of future pandemics. The findings of this study can be valuable for engineers, architects, and construction designers in developing more resilient and sustainable building solutions.

During a pandemic, it's important to make sure that our homes are safe and healthy. This means taking steps to prevent the spread of viruses. One way to do this is by using new smart technologies, like shoe cleaning systems and enhanced ventilation. Another way is by using touchless technologies, like motion sensors and keycard swiping, to avoid touching infected surfaces. We can also create self-cleaning spaces to avoid getting infected from high-touch surfaces. It's also important to choose indoor materials that can kill pathogens, like copper, and to let natural light in, which can help kill germs. Lastly, we should be able to control the temperature and humidity inside our homes, as high temperature and humidity can help stop viruses from spreading.
