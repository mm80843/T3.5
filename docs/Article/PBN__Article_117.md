This research paper presents a deep learning-based framework for monitoring social distancing in a sustainable smart city scenario to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework utilizes state-of-the-art object detection models (Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD) to detect pedestrians in real-time video surveillance footage. The video is transformed from a perspective view to a bird's eye view to define the region of interest for monitoring social distancing. The distance between pedestrians is calculated in the bird's eye view to detect any violation of social distancing norms. The framework generates non-intrusive audio-visual alerts to warn the crowd in case of violations. The performance of the framework is evaluated using precision and recall metrics, and YOLO is found to be the most effective model. The framework has potential implications for the sustainable development of smart cities by ensuring the safety of citizens and minimizing economic losses. However, concerns about privacy and individual rights should be addressed by obtaining consent and concealing identities.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis caused by a virus called coronavirus. It started in China and has spread to many countries around the world. The virus is very contagious and can make people sick with symptoms like cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. To stop the spread of the virus, it is important to practice social distancing. This means staying at least 6 feet away from other people, avoiding crowded places, and not touching others. Many countries are using technology, like cameras and sensors, to monitor social distancing in public areas. By following these measures, we can help protect ourselves and others from getting sick.
