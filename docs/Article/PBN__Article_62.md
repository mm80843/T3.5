## Short summary of the article

This study introduces the Intelligent Built Environment Monitor (IBEM), an intelligent indoor environmental quality (IEQ) monitoring and feedback system. IBEM consists of an integrated sensor, a cloud server, a database, a web platform, and a mobile interface. The system enables continuous monitoring of IEQ parameters such as air temperature, humidity, CO2, PM2.5, and illuminance. The IBEM device has been validated through a co-location experiment with reference sensors, showing strong correlations and slight deviations. IBEM has been deployed in 131 buildings in China, creating a comprehensive IEQ database with over 1TB of data. The system has been used for targeted IEQ diagnosis in offices and hospitals, identifying inadequate thermal conditions and poor indoor air quality. The system also collects occupant feedback, and analysis of subjective and objective data reveals insights into occupant satisfaction and preferences. IBEM offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for large-scale IEQ monitoring and feedback, enhancing our understanding of IEQ in real-world scenarios.

## Summary of the article

IBEM (Intelligent Built Environment Monitor) is a system that helps monitor the quality of the air indoors. It has sensors that measure things like temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, dust particles, and light levels. The system can be connected to the internet and data is stored in a cloud server for analysis. It also has a mobile app that allows people to see the air quality in real-time and provide feedback on their satisfaction with the indoor environment. The system has been tested in different types of buildings, like offices and hospitals, and has helped diagnose and improve the indoor air quality. It is a useful tool for understanding and making indoor spaces healthier for people to live and work in.
