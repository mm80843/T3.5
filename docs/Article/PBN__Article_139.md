## Short summary of the article

This study proposes an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic and the economic effects of social distancing interventions. The model emulates a closed society living on a shared environment, consisting of agents representing people, houses, businesses, the government, and the healthcare system. The model incorporates complex social, epidemiological, and economic relationships. Seven different scenarios were simulated, including a do nothing scenario, lockdown, conditional lockdown, vertical isolation, partial isolation, use of face masks, and use of face masks with partial isolation. The simulations showed that lockdown and conditional lockdown were the most effective scenarios in controlling the number of infected individuals and deaths. However, these scenarios also had the worst economic losses, with potential unemployment and recession. The scenario combining the use of masks and partial isolation of the population could be a good compromise, as it flattened the infection curve and had smoother economic effects compared to lockdown scenarios. The model provides a useful tool for policymakers and health authorities in planning actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. Future research aims to improve the model by implementing mechanisms to close and open businesses and allowing for job loss.

## Summary of the article

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It started in China in December 2019 and has since spread to many countries, including Brazil. COVID-19 has affected all aspects of life, including health, education, and the economy. To understand how the disease spreads and how to stop it, scientists have developed computer models to simulate the epidemic. One such model, called the Agent-Based Model (ABM), was used in this study to simulate the effects of different social distancing interventions, like lockdowns and wearing masks. The results showed that strict lockdowns were the most effective in preventing infections and deaths, but they also had a negative impact on the economy. Partial isolation, with the use of face masks, was found to be a good compromise between controlling the disease and minimizing economic losses. This kind of simulation can help policymakers make informed decisions to protect people's health while also considering the impact on the economy.
