In this study, researchers looked at how digital tools are being used in Brazilian cities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. They found that 83% of the cities surveyed are using digital strategies to adapt to the pandemic. These strategies include things like online learning for students, virtual doctor appointments, and using technology to share information with the public. The researchers also found that cities with a higher GDP per capita and a history of using digital tools were more likely to adopt these strategies. Overall, the study shows that technology is being used to help cities respond to the challenges of the pandemic and find new ways to provide services and support to their residents.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research aims to characterize the use of digital tools in the adaptation of Brazilian cities to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the concept of smart cities. The study surveyed the adoption of digital tools by public administration in the hundred largest Brazilian cities to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. The results indicate that 83% of the cities surveyed have implemented digital strategies, with a concentration of initiatives in areas with a history of technological innovation. The use of digital technology in optimizing services indicates that the surveyed cities are following a global trend of adopting smart city strategies. The research highlights the importance of technology in managing public services during the pandemic, including teleconsultations, digital platforms for information sharing, and virtualization of municipal services. The study also emphasizes the need to consider factors such as GDP per capita and technological infrastructure in understanding the adoption of digital tools in different regions. Overall, the research suggests that the adoption of digital tools in Brazilian cities is both a response to the pandemic and a reflection of ongoing efforts to enhance urban governance through technology.
