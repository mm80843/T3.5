## Summary of the article

A type of ultraviolet (UV) light called far-UVC is being studied as a way to kill viruses and bacteria without harming humans. Far-UVC light cannot penetrate the skin or eyes, so it won't hurt us, but it can still kill germs in the air. In this study, scientists tested how well far-UVC light could kill two types of human coronaviruses in aerosol droplets (tiny particles in the air). They found that a low dose of far-UVC light could inactivate 99.9% of the viruses. This means that far-UVC light could be used in public places like hospitals, schools, and transportation vehicles to help prevent the spread of viruses like the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

## Short summary of the article

Far-UVC light at a wavelength of 222 nm has been shown to efficiently kill airborne human coronaviruses, including HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. This study used an aerosol irradiation chamber to determine the efficacy of far-UVC light in inactivating these viruses. The results showed that a dose as low as 1.2 to 1.7 mJ/cm2 of 222 nm light can inactivate 99.9% of the airborne human coronaviruses tested. The inactivation rate constant for HCoV-229E was 4.1 cm2/mJ, while for HCoV-OC43 it was 5.9 cm2/mJ. These values suggest that far-UVC light is comparable in efficiency to conventional germicidal 254 nm UVC light in inactivating aerosolized coronaviruses. The sensitivity of different coronaviruses to far-UVC light is likely due to differences in structure and genome size. The use of far-UVC light in occupied public spaces, such as hospitals, transportation vehicles, and schools, could potentially reduce the spread of airborne-mediated viruses. The safety of continuous low-dose far-UVC exposure has been demonstrated, and staying within regulatory dose limits could provide a significant reduction in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
