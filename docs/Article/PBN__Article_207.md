The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on the water cycle in cities. It has changed the way people use water and has affected the quality of water. Some water bodies may have improved in quality because of less pollution, but sources like reservoirs and aquifers have not been affected much. Water treatment plants have had to increase the amount of chlorine in drinking water to kill the virus, which can cause other problems. The pandemic has also affected wastewater collection and treatment, causing an increase in solid waste and changes in the concentration of chemicals in the water. Digital technology and data analysis are being used to monitor the water system and make it more efficient. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having a safe and reliable water supply and has highlighted the need to prepare for future challenges like climate change.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the urban water cycle and the potential role of digitalisation in the water industry. The pandemic has caused significant changes in water demand and usage patterns, leading to impacts on the water cycle. These impacts include changes in water quality, the need for increased chlorination in drinking water, and challenges in wastewater collection and treatment. The financial sustainability of water utilities is also at risk due to decreased revenue and increased costs. The pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the water sector, with the potential for increased use of digital technologies such as smart meters, sensors, and AI in water management. The monitoring of wastewater can play a key role in tracking the spread of the virus and informing public health measures. Digitalisation can also support decision-making processes, improve customer service, and enhance the resilience of water systems. However, it is important to ensure the accuracy and quality of data in digital systems and consider the ethical and privacy implications of digitalisation. Finally, the pandemic highlights the need to re-think and rebuild water systems to address future challenges such as climate change and other potential outbreaks.
