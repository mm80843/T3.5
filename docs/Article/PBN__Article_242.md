During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have had to stay at home and limit their physical activities and interactions with others. This has made people feel more stressed, anxious, and isolated. But, researchers have found that doing exercise at home can help improve mental health and make people feel happier and less stressed. Exercise can also help people feel more confident and in control of difficult situations. However, during the pandemic, many children and adolescents have been doing less physical activity. It's important for people to find ways to stay active and do exercises that they enjoy to promote their mental health during this time.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes a study that explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activities and the relationship between physical activity and mental health. The study finds that the pandemic has led to a decline in physical activity, especially among children and adolescents. However, engaging in physical exercise at home can still maintain and improve mental health during the pandemic. Various mechanisms, both physiological and psychological, have been proposed to explain the positive effects of physical activity on mental health. Coping behaviors, such as engaging in physical activities, can help mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health. Home-based exercise, such as yoga and exergames, has shown positive effects on mental health during the pandemic. Factors that hinder physical activity during the pandemic include existing health conditions, quarantine and lockdown measures, social distancing, and the type, intensity, and frequency of physical activity. Gender, age, and country differences, as well as contextual variables such as exercise monitoring and support from family and friends, can moderate the relationship between physical activity and mental health. Future research is needed to further explore these relationships, examine different demographic variables, compare the impacts of public health restrictions, and explore effective strategies for promoting physical activity during times of crisis.
