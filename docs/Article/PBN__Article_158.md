# __Startups in times of crisis – A rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic__

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on innovative startups and the measures that can be taken to support them. The study found that startups face immediate consequences such as reduced sales and liquidity challenges during the crisis. The economic climate is also unfavorable for innovation due to the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. However, startups are showing resilience and adapting to the crisis by relying on relational capabilities, adopting bricolage approaches, and adjusting their organizational infrastructure. The study also highlights the importance of entrepreneurial crisis management in fostering resilience and minimizing the negative impacts of the crisis. Policy responses to the crisis should focus on ensuring startups have access to sufficient resources, and regions with strong entrepreneurial ecosystems are better positioned to recover from the crisis. International policy responses have primarily focused on short-term aid for SMEs and startups, but long-term measures to address fundamental issues are also emerging. The study emphasizes the need for policymakers to support startups specifically and incentivize investors to provide growth capital. Overall, the study provides actionable measures for both entrepreneurs and policymakers to protect and support innovative startups during the COVID-19 crisis.
