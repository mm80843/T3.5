## Summary of the article

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way for computers to understand and analyze human language, like tweets or articles. It can help us learn about people's emotions and opinions. NLP is used in many industries to get insights from texts and make decisions. One way NLP does this is by using algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to figure out the main topics in texts. These algorithms help people understand how Covid-19 is impacting different areas like finance, healthcare, and technology. They analyze the words in articles to find the important topics. This can help us understand how Covid-19 is affecting the economy and other industries.

## Short summary of the article

This study focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to analyze the non-medical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors of the global economy. The researchers collected a dataset of COVID-19 media articles from January to May 2020 and preprocessed the data by cleaning and tokenizing the text. LDA was used to identify topics within the dataset, while NMF was used for document clustering. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as coherence score and perplexity. The results showed that LDA performed better in identifying relevant topics and NMF provided insight into the semantic meaning of each topic. The study identified the areas most impacted by the pandemic, including finance, technology, healthcare, automobile, international relations, and general industries. The findings can help policymakers and decision-makers understand the effects of the pandemic and make informed decisions to mitigate its impact. Future research directions include optimizing hyperparameters and evaluating the models on unseen data.
