# __Continuous IEQ monitoring system: Context and development__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.12.010

## Short summary of the article

The paper introduces the development of a low-cost, pervasive indoor environmental quality (IEQ) monitoring system called SAMBA, intended for use in commercial office buildings. SAMBA consists of hardware for autonomous data acquisition and a cloud software platform for data transformation, storage, and visualization. The system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) framework, wireless sensor networks, and big data analytics to efficiently monitor and analyze IEQ parameters in real-time. SAMBA aims to provide timely and actionable IEQ data to building operators, as well as contribute to a large research database of commercial building IEQ performance. The paper also discusses the design considerations and technical specifications of SAMBA, including sensor selection, network topology, firmware, and the IEQAnalytics web service. The web service offers a real-time dashboard for users to view IEQ measurements, compliance calculations, IEQ rating, and other performance metrics. Overall, SAMBA offers an innovative and scalable approach to IEQ monitoring in commercial buildings.

## Summary of the article

SAMBA is a system that helps monitor the indoor environment in commercial office buildings. It uses special devices called SAMBA devices to measure things like temperature, air quality, lighting, and sound. These devices are placed around the building and send the data they collect to a central server. The server then analyzes the data and provides feedback to the building owners and tenants about how the indoor environment is performing. This helps them make improvements to things like comfort and wellness for the people who work in the building. The system is also used for research purposes to learn more about how the indoor environment affects people's health and well-being.
