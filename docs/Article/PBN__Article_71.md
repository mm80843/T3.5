# __Characterization and performance evaluation of a full-scale activated carbon-based dynamic botanical air filtration system for improving indoor air quality__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research article focuses on the potential use of plants to improve indoor air quality by removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study evaluates the effectiveness of a dynamic botanical air filtration system (DBAF) in removing water soluble and non-soluble VOCs under full-scale and realistic ventilation conditions. The DBAF prototype consists of a filter bed containing activated carbon and porous shale pebbles, along with plants and microorganisms. The study finds that the DBAF is effective in removing formaldehyde and toluene, with high initial removal efficiencies even without plants in the bed. The long-term performance of the DBAF is also evaluated, showing sustained removal efficiency over a 300-day period. Additionally, the study examines the impact of the DBAF on air temperature and relative humidity, finding a slight decrease in temperature and an increase in humidity. Furthermore, the study investigates the energy-saving potential of the DBAF and estimates that integrating the system into the HVAC system of a commercial building could result in a 10.5% energy saving. Overall, the study highlights the potential of botanical air filtration systems for improving indoor air quality and reducing energy consumption in buildings.

## Summary of the article

Indoor air quality (IAQ) is very important because it can affect our health and productivity. Studies have shown that indoor air can be more polluted than outdoor air. One way to improve indoor air quality is by using plants. Plants can absorb harmful gases and clean the air. However, there are different methods and systems for using plants to clean the air, and more research is needed to understand how well these systems work. One system, called the dynamic botanical air filtration system (DBAF), uses plants along with activated carbon and microorganisms to clean the air. Tests have shown that the DBAF can effectively remove formaldehyde and toluene from the air. It can also help save energy in buildings. Overall, using plants to clean indoor air shows promise, but more research is needed to fully understand its effectiveness.
