# __The efficacy of social distance and ventilation effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 transmission__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This study aims to investigate the impacts of social distance and ventilation effectiveness on the infection risk of COVID-19. The distance index (Pd) and ventilation index (Ez) were introduced into the Wells-Riley model, which is commonly used to predict infection risk. The study analyzed the distribution and transmission of respiratory droplets during talking and calculated the transmission distance of droplets based on their size. The study also considered the evaporation of droplets during transmission and its effect on transmission distance. The calibrated model showed reasonable accuracy in predicting infection rates for various scenarios. The study projected the infection risk in different confined spaces and found that social distancing and ventilation play important roles in mitigating the risk of infection. The required minimum ventilation rate to achieve a target infection probability of 2% was determined and found to be influenced by social distancing. The study concluded that increasing social distance and improving ventilation effectiveness are effective measures to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the study has limitations in terms of not considering other transmission routes and uncertainties in initial infection probability. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding the impact of social distance and ventilation on the transmission of COVID-19 in indoor spaces.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how the coronavirus spreads through respiratory droplets when people talk, cough, and sneeze. They found that the droplets can travel different distances depending on their size. The larger droplets can travel up to 8.2 meters (26 feet), while smaller droplets can evaporate and stay in the air for longer. Social distancing is important to prevent the transmission of the virus, but keeping 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) apart might not be enough. The study also emphasized the role of ventilation in reducing the risk of infection in confined spaces, like buses, classrooms, and offices. It concluded that a combination of social distancing and good ventilation is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
