This research abstract summarizes a study that proposes an integrated framework of digital transformation technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The study highlights the benefits and challenges of using these technologies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The proposed framework consists of four main components: data sources, digital transformation technologies, applications, and users. It utilizes emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, and telemedicine to improve efficiency and effectiveness in managing the pandemic. The study emphasizes the importance of data acquisition and integration, privacy, governance, expertise, scalability, legislation, infrastructure, cost, adoption, and trust as key challenges in implementing this framework. The researchers conclude that a holistic approach that integrates various digital transformation technologies can help mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic and improve the healthcare system.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a disease caused by a virus that attacks people's respiratory system. It spreads very quickly and has affected millions of people around the world. The virus can cause fever, cough, breathing problems, and tiredness. To try and stop the virus from spreading, many countries have implemented lockdowns and quarantine measures, which means people have to stay at home and cannot go to work. This has led to many people losing their jobs and the economy suffering. There are new technologies, like robots and artificial intelligence, that can help fight the pandemic by diagnosing and treating patients, as well as preventing the spread of the virus. These technologies can collect and analyze health data to help healthcare professionals monitor patients and make better decisions. However, there are also challenges, like privacy and the need for experts to use these technologies. Overall, these technologies have the potential to improve the healthcare system and reduce the negative effects of the pandemic.
