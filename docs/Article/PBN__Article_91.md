# __A critical review of emerging technologies for tackling COVID ‐19 pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.1002/hbe2.237

## Short summary of the article

Emerging technologies such as AI, virtual reality, GIS, and blockchain have been utilized to combat the spread of COVID-19. AI algorithms have been used for contact tracing, diagnosis, and prediction of COVID-19 cases. However, the limited availability of data poses a challenge to the effectiveness of AI models. Virtual reality technology has been used for training and education of healthcare professionals, promoting social distancing and nonphysical contact. GIS tools have been used for tracking and mapping COVID-19 hotspots, analyzing migration patterns, and making informed decisions. Blockchain technology has been implemented for secure sharing and streaming of health data, securing electronic medical records, and ensuring accurate delivery of medication to COVID-19 patients. However, the adoption of these emerging technologies is hindered by challenges such as limited access to data, privacy concerns, and scalability issues. Future work should focus on strengthening these technologies and addressing ethical considerations when using them to tackle the pandemic.

## Summary of the article

Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have been used to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. AI has been used to track and predict the spread of the virus, but it can be limited by a lack of data and the accuracy of the models. Virtual reality technology has been used for training healthcare professionals and providing remote consultations. Blockchain technology has been used to secure medical records and ensure the privacy of people's data. These technologies have the potential to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
