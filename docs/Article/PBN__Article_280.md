The Coronavirus outbreak, also known as COVID-19, started in China and has caused cities to close down and take precautions to stop the spread of the virus. Other countries around the world are also being careful because they don't want the virus to spread. The World Health Organization has called this outbreak a global emergency, which means it is a serious health risk to many countries. Scientists have been sharing information about the virus through a special platform to help find a cure and prevent the spread. Smart cities, which use technology to make cities safer and more efficient, can also help detect and manage outbreaks like this. But there are challenges in sharing data between different smart city products. It is important to standardize communication so that cities can work together in case of future outbreaks. The outbreak of the virus not only affects people's health but also impacts the economy of cities and countries. By working together and sharing data, we can better control and contain outbreaks like this in the future.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cities and the importance of standardized communication and data sharing in smart cities to effectively manage and respond to such crises. The abstract highlights the rapid spread of the virus and the uncertainties surrounding it, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a global public health emergency. It emphasizes the role of technology and data sharing in responding to outbreaks, using the example of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform. The abstract further explores the potential of smart city technologies, such as thermal cameras and IoT sensors, for early detection of outbreaks and the importance of collaboration and standardization between different devices and platforms. It also discusses the challenges and geopolitical issues related to data control and sharing. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the economic and social impacts of outbreaks on cities and the need for standardized protocols and communication to effectively manage health crises.
