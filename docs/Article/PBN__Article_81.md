## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic is a really big problem that is affecting the whole world. It is making people sick and causing a lot of people to die. It has also caused a lot of problems for the economy, politics, and tourism. Tourism is when people travel to different places for vacation. But because of COVID-19, people can't travel as much because it is not safe. The virus spreads easily and can make people very sick. It has also made people scared to travel because they are afraid of getting sick. This study looked at how COVID-19 is affecting the way people plan their vacations. They found that people are changing their vacation plans because of the virus. They are choosing to go to safer places and do outdoor activities. They are also shortening their vacations and being more careful about who they travel with. It's important for people to be safe and take precautions when traveling during COVID-19.

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourists' behavior and vacation plans. The study finds that the perception of COVID-19 as a travel risk leads to changes in vacation behavior, such as altering destination choices, accommodation preferences, and travel activities. COVID-19 risk perception also influences the decision to travel internationally or domestically and the duration of vacations. Additionally, the study reveals the presence of travel anxiety due to COVID-19, which further affects vacation plans, particularly in terms of not traveling or reducing the length of trips. The findings highlight the need for specific strategies to address travel anxiety and reduce perceived travel risks in order to restore international tourism demand. The study also suggests that post-pandemic tourism may become more sustainable, with tourists opting for smaller, isolated accommodations and engaging in more outdoor activities. However, the study acknowledges limitations in terms of its geographical scope and the need for further research on tourists' behavior and anxiety in different cultural contexts.
