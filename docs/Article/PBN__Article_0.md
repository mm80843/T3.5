Scientists conducted a study to see if they could find traces of the new coronavirus in wastewater, which is the water that goes down the drain from homes and businesses. They collected samples from different wastewater treatment plants in Germany and tested them for genetic material from the virus. They found that the virus's genetic material was present in the wastewater, which suggests that it can be detected this way. They also compared the amount of genetic material in the water and in solid waste, and found that there was more in the solid waste. However, they found that the wastewater samples did not contain live, infectious virus particles. This means that although the genetic material is present in the wastewater, it is not likely to make people sick.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This study investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater samples collected from nine municipal wastewater treatment plants in Germany during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The samples were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect specific genes of the virus, as well as pan-genotypic gene sequences of other coronaviruses. The study found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the untreated wastewater samples, indicating the presence of the virus in the population. The RT-qPCR analysis also showed differences in the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material between the solid and liquid phases of the wastewater samples. While the viral RNA was detected in the solid phase, its concentration was higher in the liquid phase, possibly due to the repartitioning of genetic material during wastewater treatment. The study also found that the detected SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the wastewater samples was non-infectious based on tests conducted on cultured cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of wastewater-based monitoring as a tool to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population.
