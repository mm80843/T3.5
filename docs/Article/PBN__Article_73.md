This study focuses on the use of engineering controls to reduce occupational exposure to COVID-19 in workplaces. Engineering controls, which are measures that minimize or prevent exposure without relying on workers' behaviors, are found to be the most effective solution. Ventilation is an important aspect of engineering controls, as indoor transmission of the virus through aerosols is a major concern. Increasing air exchanges, avoiding air recirculation, and increasing the use of outdoor air are recommended to improve ventilation efficiency. The use of high-efficiency air filters and portable air cleaners with HEPA filters can also help remove particles from the air. Physical barriers, such as plexiglass, can be installed to maintain social distancing and limit human-to-human interactions. Administrative controls, such as reducing the number of workers and minimizing face-to-face meetings, as well as the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), are also important in controlling the exposure. Overall, a combination of these control measures is recommended to protect workers against COVID-19 in occupational settings.

COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It has spread all over the world and many people have gotten sick and even died from it. Some jobs are more risky than others when it comes to getting infected with the virus. Healthcare workers like doctors and nurses who take care of sick people are at the highest risk. Other jobs like transportation workers and people who work in stores also have some risk. To protect workers from getting sick, different measures can be taken. One way is to improve the ventilation in buildings by bringing in fresh air from outside. Another way is to use special filters in the air conditioning systems to catch the tiny virus particles. Physical barriers like plastic shields can also be used to keep people apart. Workers can also wear special protective equipment like masks and gloves to stay safe. It's important for employers and health professionals to follow the guidelines and make sure workplaces are as safe as possible.
