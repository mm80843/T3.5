A summary is a short version of a longer piece of writing. It's like when you tell someone about a movie you saw and you only give them the important parts. It's a way to get the main ideas across without all the extra details. You write a summary using just a few sentences that explain what the story or article is about.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of climate change on coastal ecosystems and the potential consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. The research utilizes empirical data, modeling approaches, and literature reviews to assess the current and projected changes in coastal environments due to climate change. The findings reveal that rising sea levels and increasing temperatures pose significant threats to coastal ecosystems, leading to habitat loss, alterations in species distributions, and changes in ecological processes. In addition, climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems can have cascading effects on ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, fisheries, and carbon sequestration. The study also highlights the importance of adaptive management strategies and policy interventions to mitigate and manage the impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems and safeguard their invaluable services. Overall, this research underscores the critical need for urgent action and global cooperation to protect and preserve coastal ecosystems in the face of climate change.
