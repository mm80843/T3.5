## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to investigate the mode of transmission and extent of environmental contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a dedicated outbreak center in Singapore. Surface environmental samples and personal protective equipment (PPE) samples were collected from patients' rooms and study physicians. Air sampling was also conducted in the room, anteroom, and outside the room. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed extensive environmental contamination in one patient's room, including positive samples from toilet surfaces, suggesting the potential for fecal shedding as a route of transmission. However, samples taken after routine cleaning were negative, indicating that current decontamination measures are effective. Air samples were negative despite the environmental contamination, but samples taken from air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting the deposition of droplets on equipment. Only one PPE swab, from a shoe front, tested positive. Overall, this study highlights the importance of strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

## Summary of the article

People who have a virus called SARS-CoV-2 can spread it to others through the air and by touching things. A study was done in Singapore to see if the virus was on surfaces in rooms where sick people were staying. They found that one patient had the virus on many surfaces in their room, like the toilet and sink. But after the room was cleaned, the virus was no longer there. This means that the cleaning methods they used were effective. The study also found that the virus was not in the air, even though it was on surfaces. More research is needed to learn more about how the virus spreads.
