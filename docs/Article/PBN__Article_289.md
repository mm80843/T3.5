The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the validity of energy social science research. In this paper, the authors aim to highlight principles that energy social science researchers can use to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the validity of their work during and after the pandemic. These principles include considering the possible impacts of the pandemic on research findings, adjusting research design and data collection methods, and reporting extra contextual detail. By following these principles, researchers can have greater confidence in the validity of their work. The authors also discuss challenges to validity, such as the need to balance internal and external validity, and the importance of considering the stability of findings over time. They emphasize the importance of a particular focus on energy studies, given the significant impacts of the pandemic on energy use. The paper provides a checklist for researchers to address the impacts of the pandemic on their research, and highlights opportunities for collaboration and new insights in energy social science research.
