# __COVID-19 and regional solutions for mitigating the risk of SME finance in selected ASEAN member states__

## Short summary of the article

This research paper investigates the credit guarantee ratios for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in selected ASEAN countries, with a focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses an econometric technique to model the credit guarantee ratios based on macroeconomic variables, bank-level variables, and SME policy variables. The research aims to contribute to the existing literature by studying the relationship between the credit guarantee ratio and different variables, developing a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to analyze the loan default ratio response to macroeconomic and bank-level impulses, and calculating the optimal credit guarantee ratio for each group of banks during different stages of the COVID-19 crisis. The findings show that the credit guarantee ratio should vary for different banks based on their financial soundness. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the credit guarantee ratio needs to be increased in the emergency stage and gradually reduced as the economy moves towards the new normal stage. The research has important policy implications, suggesting that governments should provide higher guarantee ratios to sound banks and increase the credit guarantee ratio to support SMEs during the pandemic. The study also highlights the potential benefits of establishing a regional credit guarantee scheme in ASEAN.

## Summary of the article

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are really important for the economy because they create jobs and help countries grow. In Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, SMEs contribute a lot to the economy and provide a lot of jobs. But one of the problems that SMEs face is that it is hard for them to get loans from banks. Banks are more likely to give loans to big companies because they are less risky. This makes it difficult for SMEs to get the money they need to grow. One way to help SMEs is by setting up credit guarantee schemes, where the government guarantees loans to SMEs. This makes it easier for SMEs to get loans because the banks feel more confident that they will get their money back. The optimal credit guarantee ratio depends on factors like the strength of the bank, the economy, and government policies. By setting the right credit guarantee ratio, the government can help SMEs access the finance they need to grow and succeed.
