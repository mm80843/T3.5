# __Resilient Built Environment: Critical Review of the Strategies Released by the Sustainability Rating Systems in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.3390/su132011164

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes the study's focus on the strategies developed by Sustainability Rating Systems (SRS) to minimize the transmission of infectious diseases, with a specific emphasis on the COVID-19 pandemic. The SRS examined in this study include WELL, Fitwel, and LEED, which have released evidence-based strategies in response to COVID-19. The aim of the study is to assess the strategies developed by these SRS and determine their level of sustainability. The study examines the degree of sustainability in terms of environmental, social, and economic factors for each strategy. The results show that strategies related to the built environment have a higher environmental and economic impact, while company policies are easier to implement. The study also highlights limitations of the SRS, including their weak sustainability approach and lack of analytical strategies addressing occupancy rates and physical distancing. Overall, this study provides a critical review of the strategies developed by SRS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and assesses their level of sustainability. Supplementary materials with detailed strategies addressed by the SRS are provided.

## Summary of the article

In this text, we learn about different types of coronaviruses, including the one that caused the COVID-19 pandemic. We also learn about how the virus spreads from person to person and how it can cause different symptoms. The text talks about measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus in buildings, such as increasing ventilation and cleaning surfaces. It also discusses the different sustainability rating systems that have been developed to make sure buildings are safe and healthy for people to use. However, the text also highlights some limitations in these rating systems, such as the lack of strategies addressing occupancy rates and physical distancing. Overall, the text shows the importance of creating safe and sustainable indoor environments to protect against infectious diseases like COVID-19.
