## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to understand the perception of Spanish households during the COVID-19 lockdown and its relationship with housing. The research used a mixed method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data collection. The quantitative part involved an online questionnaire with 1804 responses, while the qualitative part included photographs and narratives from 242 participants. The results showed that teleworking was the most dedicated task during the lockdown, with changes in use and occupation habits, especially in relation to leisure and sports activities. The qualitative analysis revealed that the least pleasant aspects of the home were small, untidy, and poorly lit spaces, while the most comfortable spaces were living rooms, bedrooms, and areas open to the outside. The study also highlighted the importance of habitability qualities, such as the design and equipment of the dwelling, in determining the comfort and well-being of households during lockdown. The findings suggest that improvements in housing design and renovation processes are needed to create more resilient and comfortable homes, especially in terms of indoor environmental quality and access to resources. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the experiences of Spanish households during the COVID-19 lockdown and the importance of housing in facilitating well-being in such circumstances.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how Spanish households experienced the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. They used both quantitative and qualitative methods to gather information. The quantitative part involved an online questionnaire that asked about the characteristics of the households and their homes, as well as changes in habits and energy consumption. The qualitative part asked participants to take photos of their homes and answer questions about them. The study found that teleworking was the most common activity during the lockdown, and that households spent more time on domestic tasks. It also found that many households were not satisfied with the quality of their homes, especially small and poorly lit spaces. The study suggests that improvements to housing design and renovation should be made to ensure better habitability and comfort, especially in times of crisis like the lockdown.
