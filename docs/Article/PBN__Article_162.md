## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on water and wastewater management. It highlights the importance of proper management of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of wastewater surveillance as a tool for monitoring and tracking the spread of the virus is emphasized, along with the need for effective treatment and disinfection of wastewater. The abstract also explores the role of digitalization, artificial intelligence, and robotics in combating COVID-19, as well as the importance of contact tracing and the use of biosensors for early detection. It concludes by discussing the potential of predictive analytics, geospatial analysis, and knowledge management in responding to the pandemic. Overall, the abstract provides a comprehensive overview of the various approaches and technologies being employed to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in the water and wastewater sector.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces. The virus can survive in wastewater and there are concerns about its potential spread through water systems. Wastewater surveillance is an important tool for monitoring and tracking the virus in water and public health. Scientists use different methods like sampling, analysis, and mathematical models to understand and predict the spread of the virus. Bio-sensors and digital technology, like mobile apps and robots, are also being used to detect and track the virus. It is important to protect people's privacy and ensure ethical use of these technologies. The goal is to manage and control the pandemic while minimizing the impact on society and the economy.
