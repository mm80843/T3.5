The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces. The virus can survive in wastewater and there are concerns about its potential spread through water systems. Wastewater surveillance is an important tool for monitoring and tracking the virus in water and public health. Scientists use different methods like sampling, analysis, and mathematical models to understand and predict the spread of the virus. Bio-sensors and digital technology, like mobile apps and robots, are also being used to detect and track the virus. It is important to protect people's privacy and ensure ethical use of these technologies. The goal is to manage and control the pandemic while minimizing the impact on society and the economy.
