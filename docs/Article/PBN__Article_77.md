## Short summary of the article

A study from South Korea describes the process of rapidly expanding airborne-infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to accommodate COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate ward and patient rooms, considering the medical procedures needed for critical patients. Anterooms, which serve as buffer zones between patient rooms and corridors, are crucial for infection control in AIIRs. The study provides guidance on partitioning rooms or corridors to create anterooms, considering factors such as restroom location, patient bed alignment, and communication between medical personnel. Generating negative pressure in AIIRs is essential, and the study highlights the use of negative air machines to achieve reliable and stable negative pressure. The pressure differentials and air changes per hour in the AIIRs met the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study also discusses the implementation of patient monitoring systems and door-lock devices to enhance access control and patient safety. Lastly, the study emphasizes the importance of adequate healthcare personnel in the new AIIRs, with a focus on the experience and expertise of respiratory and intensive care unit workers. The authors believe that these measures contributed to the low mortality and infection rates among COVID-19 patients and healthcare personnel in South Korea.

## Summary of the article

There is a virus called SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a pandemic around the world. It started in China and has spread to many countries. The virus can make people very sick, and some people have died from it. Hospitals are running out of resources and need more rooms to help treat sick patients. They are building temporary rooms called airborne-infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to keep the virus from spreading. These rooms have special equipment and are designed to keep the air clean. Health care workers are working hard to take care of the patients in these rooms and keep themselves safe.
