# __Overcoming the Impact of COVID-19 Using Integrated Project Delivery Model__

## DOI of the article

10.21203/rs.3.rs-66806/v1

## Short summary of the article

This research paper focuses on the development of a value integrated project delivery model for the Indian Construction Sector. The objective is to understand the systematic approach of value engineering and integrate it with other project management tools such as lean construction, risk assessment, vendor management, and facility management. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Indian construction industry is also assessed. The literature review highlights the history and importance of value engineering, as well as its interdisciplinary nature. Other project management processes, such as life cycle cost analysis, lean construction, and facility management, are discussed in relation to their synergy with value engineering. The research methodology involves both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. The impact study of COVID-19 on facility management, real estate, supply chain management, labor productivity, contractual obligations, and the economic recession is explored. The paper concludes by discussing considerations for reviving the Indian construction sector, such as construction technology, productivity, digitalization, project scope and scheduling, and the bidding process. The value integrated project delivery model is proposed as a solution to improve client satisfaction and service quality in the construction industry.

## Summary of the article

Summary: This research is about finding ways to improve the construction industry in India. The main problem is that many construction projects end up costing more than planned and taking longer to finish. This is because of poor planning, bad implementation, and a lack of communication between everyone involved. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made things worse by causing delays and disruptions. The research suggests using a method called value engineering, which focuses on finding ways to make projects more efficient and cost-effective. It also recommends integrating value engineering with other project management processes like lean construction and risk management. This way, the construction industry can overcome the challenges caused by COVID-19 and improve the value of their projects.
