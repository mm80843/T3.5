This review examines the risks of tick- and mosquito-borne diseases (VBDs) in Canada in relation to climate change. The mortality rates, life cycle progress, breeding rates, and host-seeking activity of mosquitoes and ticks are all affected by temperature and humidity, making them susceptible to climate change. Different VBDs respond differently to long-term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, as well as increased climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change may lead to the emergence and spread of new VBDs in Canada, as more of the country becomes suitable for vectors and pathogens. However, the epidemiologic patterns of VBDs may vary due to the different lifecycles of mosquitoes and ticks. For example, West Nile virus has shown rapid geographic spread followed by endemicity and occasional epidemics driven by rainfall and temperature patterns. On the other hand, Lyme disease has spread slowly and maintains a relatively constant level of risk. Model-based risk assessments suggest a widespread future risk of Lyme disease in Canada, while diseases like Zika and chikungunya may be limited to certain areas in southern Canada. Urban and suburban planning can play a role in modulating the risk of VBDs. Heavy rainfall promotes mosquito breeding in suburban areas, while urban areas with stagnant pools of water in drains and sewers can act as breeding grounds. Landscape design in suburban areas can also determine the degree of contact between residents and disease vectors. The impact of VBDs in Canada will depend on how urban and suburban environments are designed, built, and managed in response to climate change.

Tick-and mosquito-borne diseases (like Lyme disease and West Nile virus) can be spread by bugs called ticks and mosquitoes. These bugs are affected by the weather, like how hot or cold it is. If the weather gets warmer because of climate change, more of these bugs can live in Canada. This means the diseases they carry can spread more easily. But, how we design our cities and suburbs can make a difference. If we have lots of green spaces and places for water to collect, like in gardens or puddles, there can be more bugs and diseases. So, we need to be careful how we design our cities to make sure we stay safe from these diseases.
