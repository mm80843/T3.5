# __Toilets dominate environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hospital__

## DOI of the article

10.1101/2020.04.03.20052175

## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to analyze the potential transmission risk of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hospital environment by performing environmental sampling in four isolation rooms housing COVID-19 patients. The study found that the most contaminated environment was the toilet, with several positive surface samples indicating fecal contamination. The detection of the virus in the corridor air and on the surface of exhaust grilles in the bathroom suggests the possible existence of airborne transmission, although the airborne concentration of the virus was found to be very low. The study also found that there were no positive samples on non-toilet object surfaces in the patients' rooms. The results imply that toilets may be high-risk areas in hospitals with COVID-19 patients, highlighting the importance of hand and environmental hygiene. The study had limitations, such as a small number of collected air samples and restricted access to patients with mild symptoms.

## Summary of the article

A study was conducted in a hospital in China to understand how the coronavirus spreads in the environment. They collected samples from the rooms of 10 patients with Covid-19, as well as other areas in the hospital. They found that the toilet was the most contaminated area, suggesting that the virus can be found in feces. They also found some positive samples on surfaces in the patients' rooms. The study suggests that good hygiene, especially in bathrooms, is important to prevent the spread of the virus. They also found a small amount of the virus in the air, but more research is needed to understand if it can be transmitted through the air.
