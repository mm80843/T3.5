## Summary of the article

The world has been dealing with a pandemic called COVID-19 since 2020. To fight the virus, mass testing campaigns and lockdowns were implemented. Vaccines have also been developed and approved to help reduce the spread of the virus. One challenge with the vaccines is that they need to be stored at very cold temperatures. To help with the vaccination process, digital technologies like mobile applications and data collection have been used to create a virtual model called a digital twin. This digital twin helps planners design and manage vaccination clinics more efficiently. By using these technologies, more people can be vaccinated in a shorter time, using fewer resources.

## Short summary of the article

This study presents the development of a digital twin for the design and management of a walk-in vaccination clinic, specifically for mass vaccination against COVID-19. The digital twin consists of a simulation model that virtually represents the vaccination process and a digital technology using mobile applications and NFC tags to collect real-time data from the physical system. The simulation model includes different patient categories, probability measures, and statistical distributions to accurately represent the process. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to find the best configuration that maximizes the efficiency of the clinic, measured by the number of patients vaccinated per nurse. The digital technology collects data on patient flow and activity durations, which are then used to create a dynamic dashboard for decision-making. A case study in South Tyrol, Italy, demonstrates the effectiveness of the digital twin in improving the clinic's efficiency and identifying areas for improvement. The study highlights the potential of digital twins in healthcare management, particularly for mass vaccination campaigns, and suggests future applications in drive-through clinics and larger-scale vaccination centers.
