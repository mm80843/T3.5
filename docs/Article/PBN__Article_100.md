# __COVID-19: Risk assessment and mitigation measures in healthcare and non-healthcare workplaces__

## DOI of the article

10.51585/gjm.2021.2.0007

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract provides a summary of a study on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the risk assessment of the virus in various workplaces. The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant public health concern that has caused high morbidity and mortality. The virus is transmitted through direct and indirect contact via respiratory droplets and/or fecal-oral routes. The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is estimated to be 2-4, indicating that one infected person can spread the virus to 2-4 individuals. COVID-19 has been transmitted within healthcare and non-healthcare facilities. The review discusses the epidemiology of COVID-19 and emphasizes the need for risk assessment and mitigation measures in workplaces. The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) procedure is recommended for healthcare risk assessment. The study also provides information on the clinical features of COVID-19 and identifies high-risk groups. The current status of the COVID-19 pandemic is outlined, and the importance of risk assessment in different workplaces is emphasized. The abstract concludes by discussing the mitigation measures that can be implemented to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in various workplaces, with a special focus on healthcare settings. The study recommends the implementation of safe work practices, enhanced ventilation systems, and administrative control measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets and can also survive on surfaces for a long time. The virus can cause flu-like symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath. It can be especially dangerous for older people and those with certain health conditions. The virus has spread all over the world and has affected a lot of people. To prevent the spread of the virus, we need to practice good hygiene, like washing our hands and wearing masks. It's also important for workplaces, especially healthcare facilities, to have safety measures in place to protect their workers.
