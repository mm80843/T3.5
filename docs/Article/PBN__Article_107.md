Housing plays a big role in the COVID-19 pandemic. In Australia, there was a lockdown in public housing buildings in Melbourne because of an infection cluster. But there were problems during the lockdown, like broken elevators and not enough food and cleaning supplies. People who live in public housing sometimes face discrimination, and this lockdown made it worse. There is a debate about how to make public housing better in response to the pandemic. This article also talks about different housing policies and studies from around the world.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This editorial reflects on the role of housing in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in relation to public housing. The lockdown of a public housing block in Melbourne, Australia due to an infection cluster sparked debates about the resources and support provided to residents during the lockdown. Issues such as broken lifts, inadequate food and sanitization supplies, and limited access to information in different languages have not only made it difficult for residents to cope, but also accelerated the spread of the virus. The stigmatization of public housing residents was exacerbated during this lockdown. This editorial introduces the Virtual Special Issue on The Transformation of Social Housing, which covers research on the restructuring and future outlook of social housing in different countries. The papers highlight the diverse changes that have occurred in the social housing sector and the contextual differences across countries. The COVID-19 pandemic presents new challenges and opportunities for social and public housing, and housing scholars have an important role in addressing the effects of housing policies, directing new housing futures, and contributing to evidence-based policy making. The issue also includes several papers and book reviews that provide valuable contributions to the field of housing research.
