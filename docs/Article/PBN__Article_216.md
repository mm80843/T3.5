The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on cities and their economies. It has shown that our cities are not prepared for a crisis like this and has raised questions about how we can make them better. The pandemic has also made existing inequalities worse, especially in cities in Italy like Milan. Many businesses have been forced to close, leading to job losses and a decrease in economic activity. The way people work and shop has also changed, with more people working from home and doing online shopping. To help cities recover, it is important to support local businesses, invest in new technologies, and create spaces for people to come together and enjoy their neighborhoods.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the impact of COVID-19 on urban systems and policies. The pandemic has exposed the fragile socio-economic and spatial structures of cities and raised questions about the need for transformative solutions in urban growth and development. The effects of the pandemic may challenge established principles and practices in urban infrastructure planning and management. The virus has exacerbated existing social, spatial, and economic inequalities, particularly in densely populated areas. This has had significant impacts on the suburbs of large urban regions in Italy, such as Lombardy. The crisis has also highlighted the polarization and separation between different sectors of the economy, particularly in Italian cities. The paper suggests that addressing these challenges requires considering the impact on the labor market and adopting measures to support proximity economies. It recommends implementing policies that prioritize smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, as well as social and territorial cohesion. The abstract also discusses the economic crisis in Italy, particularly in relation to the decrease in GDP and employment. It highlights the impact on retail sales and the real estate sector. The abstract concludes by discussing the emergence of proximity approaches in urban policies and the importance of managing placemaking paths to reshape the spatial dimension of neighborhoods and proximity economies. It suggests specific examples and measures for an urban recovery agenda based on proximity economies.
