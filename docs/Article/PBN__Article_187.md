## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes the potential use of graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) as antiviral coatings to combat the spread of infectious diseases, particularly the current COVID-19 pandemic. The abstract discusses the stability of viruses on various surfaces and the need for effective surface disinfection to prevent transmission. GBNs, specifically graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), have been found to exhibit antimicrobial activity against various types of viruses. The unique properties of GBNs, such as their negative charge, sharp edges, and nanosheet structure, contribute to their antiviral effects. The abstract also highlights the potential application of GBNs in various forms such as surface coatings, diagnostic devices, personal protective equipment, and air filtration systems. Additionally, the abstract discusses the mechanisms of action by which GBNs interact with and inactivate viruses. The abstract concludes by emphasizing the importance of further research and development of GBNs as long-lasting antiviral coatings to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

Viruses like the coronavirus can cause diseases in humans, and they can spread from person to person or through touching contaminated surfaces. Scientists are researching ways to prevent the spread of viruses, and one of the solutions they are looking at is using a material called graphene. Graphene is a very thin and strong material made up of carbon atoms. It has special properties that can help kill viruses. Graphene can be used to make special coatings that can be sprayed on surfaces to disinfect them and stop the virus from spreading. These coatings have been shown to be effective against different types of viruses. Scientists are also studying how to use graphene in other ways, like making face masks and air filters that can kill viruses. Although more research is needed, graphene has shown promise as a way to protect us from infectious diseases like the coronavirus.
