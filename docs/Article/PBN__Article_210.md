# __Covid-19 Associated Risks and Mitigation Strategies relevant for the UK Construction Industry__

## DOI of the article

10.20935/AL1485

## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant risks to the UK construction industry. The main sources of risk include the lockdown, economic recession, and social distancing measures. These risks have led to labor shortages, financial impacts, contractual problems, delayed projects, and reduced industry output. The lockdown has resulted in a shortage of employees, reduced cash flow, and increased project costs. The recession has negatively impacted productivity, increased insolvency, and led to job losses. The social distancing measures have changed working procedures, restricted access to sites, and increased health and safety concerns. While the government has implemented measures to mitigate these risks, such as financial support for businesses, sustained output and productivity have not been achieved. It is recommended that industry leaders collaborate with the Health and Safety Executive to develop industry-specific working procedures. Offsite construction, improved task planning, and timely communication of interventions can help mitigate risks and boost productivity. Early serving of notices can also prevent disputes between employers and contractors. Overall, addressing these risks and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies are crucial for the recovery of the UK construction industry.

## Summary of the article

The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the construction industry in the UK. There are three main risks: lockdown, economic recession, and social distancing. Lockdown means fewer workers and delays in projects. The recession makes it hard for businesses to pay their bills. Social distancing measures change how workers can do their jobs and may affect their mental health. To reduce risks, the government and industry leaders have taken steps, like providing financial support and creating safety guidelines. Offsite construction and better planning can also help. It's important to communicate clearly and prevent disputes between employers and workers.
