During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing managers faced many challenges. One big challenge was that there was no plan prepared in hospitals to deal with the pandemic. Another challenge was that there were not enough nurses to take care of all the patients. Some nurses were also afraid of getting sick themselves. They had to change their work schedules and make new arrangements to deal with these problems. The hospitals also had to be prepared with equipment and supplies to take care of patients with COVID-19. They also provided support to the nurses, both at the organizational level and at the individual level. Communication and collaboration between nurses and doctors were very important during this time. In the end, it was important for nursing managers to be there for their nurses and help them through this difficult time.

This study explored the challenges, practices, and organizational support faced by nursing managers in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in five university hospitals in Egypt. The challenges identified included the absence of a preparedness plan, shortage of nursing staff, and psychological issues. The study also revealed several innovative practices implemented by nursing managers, such as changes in work schedules, exchange processes between hospitals to address staff shortages, hospital preparation and training, and education for healthcare teams. Organizational support was provided through the allocation of isolation rooms, support from the infection control team, and material support from the Supreme Council of Universities. The findings of this study highlight the importance of proactive crisis management, effective communication, and collaboration between healthcare professionals, and the need for ongoing training and education. These findings can guide nursing managers and policymakers in effectively managing future waves of the pandemic.
