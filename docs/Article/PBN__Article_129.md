# __Preparing critical infrastructure for the future: Lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.35467/sdq/146603

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the importance of protecting critical infrastructure and the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the need to shift from a preventive-based approach to a resilience-based approach and the importance of effective cooperation and partnerships among stakeholders. The definition of critical infrastructure is discussed, with a focus on the importance of considering dependencies and interdependencies. The limitations of the current approach to protecting critical infrastructure are explained, including the vulnerability to cascading disruptions and the impact of global supply chain dependencies. The need for a post-COVID-19 approach based on resilience is emphasized, with a focus on identifying and managing vulnerabilities and improving organizational capabilities. The characteristics of a resilient system are discussed, including robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. The importance of coordination, communication, and information-sharing among stakeholders is highlighted, as well as the role of society in building critical infrastructure resilience. The conclusion emphasizes the need to redefine the approach to protecting critical infrastructure and to prioritize resilience.

## Summary of the article

Critical infrastructure is important because it provides essential services that we need in our everyday lives, like water, transportation, energy, and healthcare. But sometimes, unexpected events called "black swans" can happen, like the Covid-19 pandemic, and they can cause problems for our critical infrastructure. The pandemic showed that we need to change how we protect our critical infrastructure. Instead of just trying to prevent bad things from happening, we need to focus on being resilient, which means being able to bounce back and keep functioning even when something unexpected happens. This includes identifying vulnerabilities, having plans and resources in place, and working together with different groups to make sure everything keeps running smoothly. For example, during the pandemic, countries had to find different suppliers and work with different organizations to get the things they needed. Building resilience in our critical infrastructure is important so that we can be prepared for future challenges.
