## Short summary of the article

The research team in this study analyzed the concept of the smart city in South Africa and India, focusing on its integration into urban policies, municipal agendas, and civil society initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided an opportunity to observe the intersection of the smart city with pandemic response. The study identified three modes of existence of the smart city: state-led strategies, corporate-led platform urbanism, and citizen- and civil society-led interventions. These modes of existence vary in the Global North and Global South, with different priorities and concerns. The pandemic revealed the use of smart urban technologies in contact tracing, public health management, and citizen-led initiatives. The different modes of the smart city also raised questions about privacy, surveillance, and social inequalities. The articles in this special issue of the study examined the ways in which the pandemic smart city is manifested in India, South Africa, and Singapore, highlighting the complexities and tensions between different modes of existence. The research emphasizes the need for a post/de-colonial lens to understand the specific geo-histories of the pandemic smart city.

## Summary of the article

The text is about how cities are using technology to manage the pandemic. There are three main ways that cities are doing this. The first way is through Integrated Command and Control Centers, which are like control rooms where they use technology to monitor and control the virus. The second way is through digital platforms, like apps and websites, that companies use to collect data and provide services related to the pandemic. The third way is through citizens and organizations using technology to help each other and gather information that the government might miss. Each of these ways of using technology has its own benefits and challenges, and they are being used in different ways in different parts of the world. The articles in the special issue explore how cities in India, South Africa, and Singapore are using technology to manage the pandemic.
