## Short summary of the article

This article discusses the differences between the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and the implications for response measures and communication. The authors argue that while there are similarities between the two crises, they require different solutions. The first lesson is that people are more afraid of COVID-19 because it poses an immediate threat to their health, while climate change is seen as a distant threat. It is suggested that discussions about climate change should focus more on the immediate consequences and the connection to extreme weather events. The second lesson is that the public health impacts of climate change have not been adequately emphasized in communication efforts. It is important to highlight the link between climate change and infectious diseases and to talk about the immediate health impacts. The third lesson is that the temporary nature of lockdown measures for the pandemic is one reason they were accepted, but permanent transformations are needed for climate change. Climate change cannot be seen as a temporary crisis, but as an irreversible transformation that requires permanent changes in the economy, politics, and way of life. In conclusion, while there are similarities between the pandemic and climate change, the measures and communication approaches need to be tailored to the unique aspects of each crisis.

## Summary of the article

Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic are not exactly the same, even though they have some similarities. One difference is that people are more scared of getting sick themselves from COVID-19, while climate change seems like something that will mostly affect others or future generations. We need to talk more about the immediate effects of climate change and how it can affect our health. Climate change could cause more health problems and even lead to more deaths, especially in developing countries. Another difference is that the measures taken to fight COVID-19, like lockdowns, are temporary, but the actions needed to stop climate change have to be permanent changes to our way of life. So, while we can learn some lessons from the pandemic, we need different solutions to tackle climate change.
