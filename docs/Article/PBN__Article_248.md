This study aimed to investigate the impact of control measures, including travel restrictions, on the spread of COVID-19 in China. The researchers used real-time mobility data and case data with travel history to assess the role of case importation in transmission across different cities in China. They found that early on in the outbreak, the spatial distribution of cases in China could be explained by human mobility data. However, after the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, indicating successful mitigation of the spread of COVID-19. The study also highlighted the importance of Wuhan as a major source of early cases with known travel history. The authors concluded that travel restrictions are effective in the early stages of an outbreak when it is localized, but may be less effective when the outbreak is more widespread. Additionally, the combination of interventions implemented in China significantly reduced local transmission of COVID-19. Further research is needed to understand the optimal balance between public health measures and societal and economic impacts.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China and spread quickly. To stop the spread, China took different measures like travel restrictions to limit people's movement. Scientists wanted to understand how these measures affected the spread of COVID-19 in different cities in China. They used data on people's movements and case information to study this. They found that before the restrictions, many cases in other cities had traveled from Wuhan, where the outbreak started. But after the restrictions, the number of cases from Wuhan decreased and the virus spread less. This means that the control measures in China helped to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
