# __Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and their inactivation with biocidal agents__

## Short summary of the article

This research review aimed to summarize available data on the persistence of coronaviruses on different types of inanimate surfaces, as well as the efficacy of commonly used biocidal agents against coronaviruses. The study found that human coronaviruses, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days at room temperature. Veterinary coronaviruses were found to persist even longer, up to 28 days. Surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 62-71% ethanol significantly reduced coronavirus infectivity on surfaces within 1 minute of exposure. Ethanol at concentrations between 62%-71% and sodium hypochlorite at concentrations of 0.1%-0.5% were effective in reducing coronavirus infectivity in carrier tests, while benzalkonium chloride and orthophtalaldehyde were less effective. The study also emphasized the importance of hand hygiene, recommending alcohol-based hand rubs with 80% ethanol or 75% 2-propanol. While no data on the frequency of hand contamination or viral load on hands were found, hand hygiene was shown to protect against healthcare worker transmission of SARS-CoV. Overall, surface disinfection and hand hygiene practices are crucial in preventing the spread of coronaviruses in healthcare and public settings.

## Summary of the article

A new virus called coronavirus has come from China. This is the third time in 20 years that a dangerous coronavirus has appeared. It can spread from person to person, both in hospitals and in families. One way it can spread is by touching surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching our nose, eyes, or mouth. So, it's important to understand how long the virus can last on surfaces and how to get rid of it. Scientists have found that the virus can stay on surfaces for up to 9 days. But using disinfectants like alcohol or bleach can kill the virus on surfaces within 1 minute. Washing our hands with soap and water or using hand sanitizer can also help prevent the spread of the virus. So, we need to make sure to keep our hands clean and disinfect surfaces to stay safe!
