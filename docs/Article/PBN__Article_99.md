## Short summary of the article

This study provides a comprehensive review of wearable devices and their applications in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review discusses the types of wearable sensors and devices that can monitor early symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the telehealth framework for remote screening and diagnosis. The use of wearable devices for contact tracing, social distancing, and stress management is also explored. The study highlights the potential barriers to the use of wearables, such as technical issues, social interruption, and regulatory aspects, and provides potential solutions to overcome these barriers. The importance of cloud, edge, and fog computing in conjunction with wearables is also emphasized. The review concludes that wearables have the potential to significantly improve healthcare systems during the pandemic and beyond, but more research and validation studies are needed to enhance their clinical utility.

## Summary of the article

Wearable devices are special gadgets that you can wear, like a watch or a bracelet, that can help monitor your health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists and doctors have been using these wearables to track symptoms of the virus, like fever and cough. They use sensors in the devices to measure things like temperature, oxygen levels, heart rate, and even stress levels. By monitoring these things, they can get a better idea of how the virus is affecting people. Wearables can also help with things like contact tracing, which means figuring out who a sick person may have come into contact with. However, there are still some challenges with using these devices, such as making sure they are accurate and protecting people's privacy. Scientists are working on making these wearables even better, and they could be very helpful in fighting future diseases too.
