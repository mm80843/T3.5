This study aims to develop a response plan for construction organizations to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study identified 177 actions grouped into 16 categories that can help control and mitigate the effects of the pandemic on construction organizations. An online survey collected data from 43 construction organizations, revealing that health and public health directives were the top category of actions identified by respondents. Other top categories included workforce management, communication, and supplier and subcontractor engagement. These preliminary findings highlight the need for construction organizations to prioritize employee safety, assess the impact of the global economy, provide support for employee well-being, maintain regular communication, explore innovative modes of remote communication, monitor public health guidelines, and adapt procurement procedures. The study recommends ongoing data collection to develop timely recommendations for short-, medium-, and long-term planning during the pandemic.
