## Short summary of the article

This paper discusses the potential role of environmental science in monitoring the spread of Covid-19. The existing diagnostic testing methods are expensive, time-consuming, and not suitable for population-wide surveillance. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a monitoring approach that can provide community-wide data on the presence and levels of infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2, in a population. WBE has been successfully used to monitor illicit drug use and could be adapted for Covid-19 monitoring. By analyzing sewage samples, WBE can provide early warning of outbreaks, identify key subpopulations for targeted testing, and assess the effectiveness of control measures. However, there are challenges in calibrating and validating WBE methods, determining the excretion route of the virus, understanding the persistence of the virus in wastewater, and standardizing testing protocols. Collaboration and coordination on a national and international level are essential for the advancement of WBE as a public health tool in the fight against Covid-19. A centralized database of WBE research and development activities would facilitate knowledge sharing and best practices. The implementation of WBE could help guide decision-making on the reopening of economies and the targeting of resources for control and mitigation efforts. Additionally, WBE has the potential to generate valuable metadata on community-level impacts and correlations with population demographics. Improved testing strategies, including the use of biomarkers, will be needed to maximize the value of WBE in monitoring infectious diseases. Finally, a data-driven strategy that combines diagnostic testing with WBE could enhance public trust and compliance with containment measures.

## Summary of the article

Scientists are trying to find ways to track the spread of the coronavirus, and one method involves studying our sewage. Sewage is the dirty water that goes down the drains from our homes and businesses. Scientists can test the sewage for any signs of the virus, like its genetic material, to see if the virus is present in a community. This can help them understand how many people are infected, even if they don't have symptoms. It can also give them early warnings if the virus is spreading. By testing sewage, scientists can help governments make decisions about when to reopen businesses and schools. They can also find out if certain areas need more help to stop the virus from spreading. Overall, studying sewage can be an important tool in fighting the coronavirus and keeping people safe.
