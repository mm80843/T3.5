Taiwan has implemented various proactive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and minimize the impact of the epidemic. These measures include border control, case identification, containment, resource allocation, public reassurance and education, and effective communication strategies. The National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) and the National Immigration Agency integrated patients' travel history with their NHI identification card data, allowing the government to track individuals at high risk. Those identified as high risk were monitored electronically through their mobile phones. The government also established the National Health Command Center (NHCC) as the operational command point for direct communications among central, regional, and local authorities. Taiwan has rapidly implemented over 120 action items, including border control, case identification, quarantine measures, resource allocation, and public education. The government has communicated with the public in a clear and compassionate manner, with high approval ratings for their handling of the crisis. Challenges faced include language barriers for non-Taiwanese citizens and the docking of a cruise ship with confirmed infections. Taiwan's experience highlights the importance of early recognition, timely and transparent information delivery, and effective crisis management in responding to a public health crisis.

Taiwan is a country that is close to China and was expected to have a lot of cases of the coronavirus. But they took quick action to prevent the spread of the virus. They sent health declaration passes to people's phones to make it easier for them to go through immigration. If someone had traveled to a high-risk area, they were quarantined at home and monitored through their phones. Taiwan also found cases of the virus by testing people with severe respiratory symptoms. They set up a hotline for people to report any symptoms or cases they knew about. The government made sure that people under quarantine had food and regular health checks. They also provided information to the public through announcements by important officials. Overall, Taiwan did a good job in responding to the crisis and protecting its citizens.
