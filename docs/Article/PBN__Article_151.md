## Short summary of the article

This study focuses on the impact of the built environment on the transmission risk of COVID-19. The built environment refers to the human-made structures and surroundings where people live and work. The study emphasizes the importance of a healthy environment and healthy buildings in promoting the well-being and health of individuals. It discusses the relationship between past pandemics and the built environment, highlighting the role of lifestyle and built environments in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The study also examines the hygienic solutions of built forms, including personal hygiene, proper ventilation, and lighting. It proposes adaptive design interventions in the built environment to mitigate the transmission risk, such as creating shared workplaces, isolation spaces, and open relaxation spaces. The study emphasizes the need for proper hygiene maintenance in the built environment and the importance of community control to reduce transmission risks. Overall, this research provides actionable guidance for decision-makers and occupants in minimizing the transmission of infectious diseases like COVID-19 in the built environment.

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused a global public health crisis, and it has changed people's lives. The virus spreads easily, so people have to take measures like social distancing to prevent its spread. The built environment, which includes buildings and other human-made spaces, plays a big role in how viruses spread. Previous pandemics like SARS and Ebola also affected the built environment. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, guidelines are being developed to design buildings in a way that reduces the risk of transmission. This includes things like proper ventilation and lighting, creating isolation spaces for sick people, and maintaining hygiene in shared spaces. People can also take steps to keep themselves and their surroundings clean to prevent the spread of the virus.
