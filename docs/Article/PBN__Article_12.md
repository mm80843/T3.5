# __The psychological impact of COVID-19 on the mental health in the general population__

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people might feel stressed, anxious, and sad. This is because the virus has caused a lot of changes in our lives. We have to stay home and can't see our friends and family as often. Some people might even be quarantined, which means they have to stay away from others because they might have the virus. Being isolated and not being able to do our usual activities can make us feel frustrated and lonely. Some people might even develop fears about getting sick or infecting others. It's important for us to stay strong and support each other during this time.

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a review of literature on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the mental health of the general population. The COVID-19 outbreak has led to a global socio-economic crisis and psychological distress. Quarantine measures and lockdowns have caused fear, anxiety, depression, frustration, uncertainty, and other psychological problems in individuals. The psychological impact of quarantine includes generalized fear, anxiety, increased stress, mood alterations, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and emotional exhaustion. Long-term behavioral changes and delayed return to normalcy have also been reported. The outbreak has resulted in aspecific fears related to infection, pervasive anxiety, frustration, boredom, and loneliness. Social isolation and loneliness have had detrimental effects on mental well-being, including increased depression and post-traumatic stress. Risk factors for quarantine distress include alexithymia, inadequate supplies, and inadequate information from public health authorities. Protective factors include resilience and social support. Preventive strategies at the community level should be implemented to address the psychological and psychosocial impact of the outbreak, including effective communication, providing adequate psychological services, implementing hospital protocols for emergency management, and enhancing social support. Telemedicine and telephonic helplines should be utilized to ensure access to mental health services. Overall, addressing the psychological impact of fear and anxiety induced by the rapid spread of the pandemic should be a public health priority.
