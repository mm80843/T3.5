## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry, specifically focusing on the positive and negative effects on construction firms. The study involved a combination of desk research and field research, gathering information from building professionals in various sectors of the industry. The results show that the majority of projects were impacted by the pandemic, with some experiencing partial or full stoppage. Government decisions played a significant role in the stoppage of work on construction sites. The study also highlights the need for further research in order to understand the long-lasting consequences of the pandemic on the construction industry. Additionally, the abstract briefly mentions the concept of a circular economy and its potential role in resolving waste problems in the industry.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 virus, also known as the coronavirus, has spread all over the world and caused a lot of problems. It started in China but quickly spread to other countries like the United States and Europe. This virus is very serious, and it has made a lot of people sick and caused many deaths. To try to stop the virus from spreading, many countries have made strict rules like lockdowns and closing their borders. These rules have affected the construction industry because many projects had to be stopped or delayed. This has had a big impact on the economy and has caused a lot of problems for construction companies. People are trying to find new ways to deal with these problems, like using reusable materials and being more careful with how we use resources.
