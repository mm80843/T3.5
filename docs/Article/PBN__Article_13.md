# __CIDO, a community-based ontology for coronavirus disease knowledge and data integration, sharing, and analysis__

## DOI of the article

10.1038/s41597-020-0523-6

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the bottlenecks in achieving precision medicine, therapeutic drugs, and preventive vaccines for coronavirus. The first bottleneck is the disintegrated and non-interoperable nature of big data, which hinders computer-assisted reasoning and knowledge representation. The second bottleneck is the lack of bioinformatics tools to integrate and analyze heterogeneous data and knowledge. Ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO), are crucial for data integration and knowledge representation. The Open Biomedical and Biological Ontologies (OBO) Foundry promotes ontology interoperability. The recently developed Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) aims to provide standardized representation of coronavirus infectious diseases. CIDO reuses terms from existing ontologies and aligns them under the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), allowing interoperability with other ontologies. CIDO can be leveraged for rational drug and vaccine design against coronaviruses. Additionally, CIDO supports the representation of anti-coronavirus drugs and the annotation of vaccine candidates. CIDO enables community-based metadata standardization and welcomes wide community participation. It is expected to facilitate basic research on mechanisms and translational applications for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.

## Summary of the article

Scientists are trying to find ways to treat and prevent diseases like COVID-19 by using precision medicine, therapeutic drugs, and vaccines. However, there are two problems they face. First, there is a lot of data about the disease, but it is not organized in a way that computers can understand. This makes it difficult for scientists to use artificial intelligence to help them make discoveries. Second, there are not enough tools to analyze all the different types of data and information. This is slowing down the progress of finding effective treatments for COVID-19. One solution is to use ontologies, which are like dictionaries that help computers understand and organize data. For example, the Gene Ontology (GO) helps scientists study genes. There are also other ontologies that can help with COVID-19 research. By using ontologies, scientists can share and integrate data, which will help them find better treatments and vaccines for diseases like COVID-19.
