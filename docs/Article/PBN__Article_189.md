# __Mental health economics: A prospective study on psychological flourishing and associations with healthcare costs and sickness benefit transfers in Denmark__

## Short summary of the article

This study examines the association between psychological flourishing and healthcare costs in Denmark. The prevalence of flourishing in the Danish population was assessed and compared to previous years. Data from a random population-based sample of Danish adults was used, and information on healthcare costs and sickness benefit transfers was obtained from national registers. The results showed that flourishing was associated with significantly lower healthcare costs and sickness benefit transfers in the following year compared to individuals below the threshold level of flourishing. The estimated reductions in costs associated with flourishing were extrapolated to the entire Danish population, highlighting the potential financial benefits of promoting mental health and well-being. The study contributes to the growing evidence that increasing the prevalence of flourishing individuals can lead to decreased healthcare costs. However, the study has limitations, including its generalizability to other countries and the inability to establish causality. Future research is needed to explore the cost-benefit of interventions promoting flourishing and to assess the long-term effects on healthcare costs.

## Summary of the article

In Denmark, the government spends a lot of money on healthcare. The researchers wanted to see if there were certain things that could lower these costs. They found that people who were flourishing (feeling good and functioning well in life) had lower healthcare costs and sickness benefit transfers. This means that they were healthier and needed less medical help. The researchers estimated that if more people in Denmark were flourishing, the government could save a lot of money each year. This shows that it's important to focus on mental health and well-being, because it can help not only people feel better, but also save money for the government.
