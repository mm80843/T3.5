This study examines the relationship between urban green infrastructure and the resilience of cities and their populations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of green and open spaces in the City of Vienna is used as an example to illustrate the uneven distribution of greenery in cities. The study highlights the importance of green infrastructure, such as street open spaces, parks, and building greening, particularly during lockdowns and periods of restricted mobility. It discusses the challenges posed by climate change and the urban heat island effect, and how these challenges are exacerbated by the pandemic. The study emphasizes the need for green infrastructure close to homes, especially for vulnerable populations and those spending more time at home due to the pandemic. It explores the positive effects of urban green infrastructure on emotional health and well-being, and the role of green spaces in ecosystem services. The study also discusses the importance of social justice and equitable distribution of green infrastructure in urban areas. It suggests that the COVID-19 crisis offers an opportunity to prioritize green infrastructure as a means to adapt to climate change and improve the resilience of cities. The study concludes by calling for a reevaluation of the distribution of urban green infrastructure and a consideration of social and spatial justice in urban planning processes.

The coronavirus pandemic has changed life all around the world. The virus spreads when people are close to each other and when they sneeze, cough, or talk. To prevent the spread of the virus, people have to wash their hands, wear face masks, stay away from others, and stay at home if they think they might be sick. During lockdowns, many parks and green spaces were overcrowded because people wanted to get outside. But cities need more green spaces for people to enjoy and to help with problems like climate change and the coronavirus. Green spaces, like parks and trees, can cool down cities and make people feel better. They also help to distribute resources fairly and make sure everyone has access to nature. It's important for cities to have enough green spaces for everyone to enjoy.
