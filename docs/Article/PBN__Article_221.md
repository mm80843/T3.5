This research abstract summarizes a study that explores the positive and negative outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic on biodiversity conservation efforts. The study examines past perturbations and the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the implications for wildlife, habitats, income and livelihoods, conservation activities, funding, research, and engagement. The findings show that the pandemic-induced declines in conservation revenue and capacity, livelihood and trade disruptions, and the loss of food sources for wildlife have negative implications for biodiversity conservation. However, the pandemic also presents opportunities for strengthening conservation efforts through enhanced collaborations and partnerships, local investment and leadership, and fundamental institutional change. The study highlights the importance of reevaluating existing social and economic models for conservation and promoting behaviors and actions resilient to future perturbations. The research emphasizes the need for clear long-term vision, diverse income streams, community engagement, and cross-sectoral cooperation to achieve positive conservation outcomes in an uncertain future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity conservation efforts around the world. On the negative side, the pandemic has led to declines in conservation funding and capacity, disruptions in livelihoods and trade, and a reduction in monitoring and research activities. This can have long-lasting negative consequences for biodiversity and conservation efforts. However, the pandemic has also brought about positive changes, such as a temporary reduction in human movement, which has resulted in lower carbon emissions, reduced pollution, and less disturbance to wildlife. It has also provided an opportunity to rethink current unsustainable practices and strengthen conservation efforts in the future.
