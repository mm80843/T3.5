# __SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater anticipated COVID-19 occurrence in a low prevalence area__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.watres.2020.115942

## Short summary of the article

This study detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater samples from six wastewater treatment plants in the Murcia region of Spain. The study confirms the efficacy of the tertiary treatments implemented in the plants against SARS-CoV-2. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in influent water samples correlated with epidemiological data, supporting the use of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning tool for monitoring COVID-19 infection. The aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method used in the study was effective in recovering SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with MgV as a process control. The study found discrepancies in the results of different RT-qPCR assays, indicating the need for further evaluation and possible use of digital RT-qPCR. The risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater is still under debate, but the poor stability of the virus in wastewater suggests a low risk. Wastewater surveillance can provide valuable information for public health response and decision-making, particularly in the absence of widespread clinical testing.

## Summary of the article

Scientists have been studying wastewater to track the presence of the coronavirus. Wastewater is the water that goes down the drains from toilets, sinks, and showers. It contains the things that people get rid of when they use the bathroom. By testing the wastewater, scientists can see if the coronavirus is in the community, even if people don't know they have it. In this study, scientists collected untreated wastewater samples from six wastewater treatment plants in Spain. They found traces of the coronavirus in the wastewater, which means that people in that area had the virus. This method of testing wastewater could help authorities know how many people have the virus and make decisions about keeping people safe.
