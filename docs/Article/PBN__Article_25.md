## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry. The paper highlights the vulnerability of the tourism industry to crises and disasters, including infectious diseases. It reviews the concept of psychological distance and construal level theory as frameworks for understanding tourists' risk perceptions during COVID-19. The paper identifies four dimensions of psychological distance (temporal distance, spatial distance, social distance, and hypotheticality) and discusses how they are related to COVID-19. It also examines the different risks that tourists perceive in relation to the outbreak, such as health risk, psychological risk, social risk, performance risk, image risk, and time risk. The paper explores how tourists' risk perceptions influence their behavior, leading to changes in destination choices, travel patterns, and preferences. The discussion emphasizes the importance of reducing tourists' health and psychological risk perceptions and suggests strategies for destinations and industry practitioners to address these concerns. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further empirical research to test the relationships between psychological distance, perceived risk, and tourists' behavior during COVID-19. It also suggests exploring differences in risk perceptions among tourist segments and examining the impact of social media on tourists' psychological distance construal and risk perceptions.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the tourism industry. Many countries have implemented travel restrictions and closed their borders, causing a decline in international tourism. Hotel and restaurant operations have also been suspended, leading to an increase in unemployment. Tourists are now concerned about their safety when traveling and their willingness to travel has decreased. The study focuses on tourists' perceptions of risk during the pandemic and how it influences their travel behavior. It uses the concepts of psychological distance and construal level theory to understand how tourists perceive risk and make decisions about travel. The study suggests that tourists may change their destination choices, prefer smaller and more familiar accommodations, and engage in more conservative travel behavior. Future research could focus on testing these ideas and understanding the differences in risk perceptions among different tourist segments. It is also important to examine the impact of social media on tourists' risk perceptions and travel decisions. Overall, the study provides insights into the factors that influence tourists' perceptions of risk and their travel behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.
