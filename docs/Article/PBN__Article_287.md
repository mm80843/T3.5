## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a policy brief that provides an update on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on immigrants in terms of health, labor market outcomes, and training. The initial impact of the pandemic on immigrants was disproportionately negative, but there has been a significant improvement in labor market outcomes, with employment rates for immigrants returning to or near pre-pandemic levels in most OECD countries. Immigrants are more likely than the native-born to contract the disease, develop severe symptoms, and face higher mortality risks due to factors such as poor housing conditions, reliance on public transport, and limited access to healthcare and information. Immigrants from lower-income countries are particularly affected. Vaccination rates against COVID-19 are lower among immigrants, with significant differences between migrant groups and countries of origin. Immigrant women have been joining the labor market to compensate for job losses, and recent arrivals have seen more favorable employment outcomes compared to settled immigrants. The pandemic has also negatively impacted the school-to-work transition of youth, with higher rates of not being in employment, education, or training observed among both native-born and immigrant youth. The training gap between immigrants and the native-born remains significant, with immigrants less likely to participate in training programs, despite their higher risk of job automation. Overall, to ensure the integration progress of immigrants continues, addressing the training gap and the impact of school closures on the educational outcomes of children of immigrants is crucial. Additionally, efforts to improve health inclusion and literacy among foreign-born groups, including targeted communication strategies, are needed.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, immigrants were more likely to get sick, develop severe symptoms, and die from the virus. This is because immigrants often live in crowded conditions, rely on public transportation, and have frontline jobs. Immigrants from lower-income countries were especially at risk. Immigrants also had lower vaccination rates compared to native-born people, which puts them at higher risk of getting sick. In terms of the job market, immigrants were hit hard at the beginning of the pandemic, but their employment rates have started to recover. However, there are still gaps in access to training for immigrants, which is important for their long-term success. Overall, more needs to be done to address the health and employment challenges faced by immigrants during and after the pandemic.
