This research study focuses on the use of germicidal irradiation as a method to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in indoor environments, particularly in HVAC systems. The study found that germicidal irradiation, specifically in the UV-C range, can effectively disinfect the air and inactivate pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Influenza A virus, and Legionella pneumophila. Various methods of implementing UV-C irradiation were explored, including emitters in different parts of the room or HVAC system, as well as portable units. The study also compared the energy consumption and environmental impact of different HVAC operations, such as operating with germicidal irradiation versus following ASHRAE recommendations. The findings show that the use of germicidal irradiation can significantly reduce energy consumption while still ensuring health safety. Overall, this study highlights the potential of UV-C germicidal irradiation as an effective and efficient method to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor environments.

Summary: By installing germicidal sources in ventilation ducts, we can disinfect the air in buildings and reduce the risk of spreading pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These germicidal sources use UV-C radiation to inactivate viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Studies have shown that UV-C radiation can inactivate more than 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using UV-C emitters allows for the use of air circulation and recuperation while still preventing the spread of the virus. Additionally, operating germicidal sources during the heating period has a minimal impact on energy consumption. Using these sources can help keep indoor air clean and safe.
