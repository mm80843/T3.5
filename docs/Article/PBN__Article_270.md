This research abstract summarizes the findings of several recent papers on the environmental and health aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The role of meteorological factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air pollution, in COVID-19 transmission is discussed, with conflicting findings on the relationship between warmer weather and case counts. The presence and evolution of the virus in environmental compartments like water and wastewater are highlighted, emphasizing the potential of sewage epidemiology to determine the scale of the outbreak. Detection methods, such as nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are explored for both wastewater and air samples. The importance of disinfection technologies in hospitals to protect healthcare workers and patients is emphasized, with a focus on environmentally-friendly and sustainable options. The use of drug therapies, including antiviral drugs and traditional medicinal plants, is discussed, noting the ongoing clinical trials and the need for further research. Finally, the abstract concludes with recommendations for future research, including the development of standardized protocols for virus detection in wastewater and the availability of rapid tests for screening the general population and sewage.

In December 2019, a new type of pneumonia started in China called COVID-19. It spread to many countries around the world and became a big problem. Scientists are studying how the virus spreads in the environment, like in the air and in water. They found that the virus can be detected in sewage and wastewater. They also looked at how temperature, humidity, and air pollution affect the spread of the virus. Some studies showed that warmer weather can decrease the outbreak of COVID-19, but others showed that it doesn't make a difference. Air pollution may also play a role in spreading the virus. Hospitals are important places to take care of people with COVID-19, but they need to be properly disinfected to keep everyone safe. Scientists are also testing different drugs to find a treatment for COVID-19 until a vaccine is ready. There is still a lot of work to do to understand the virus and protect people from getting sick.
