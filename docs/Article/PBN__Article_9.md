## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the potential use of 5G technology in addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors highlight the various ways in which 5G can support the healthcare sector in providing remote healthcare services, such as telehealth, telemedicine, telenursing, telepharmacy, and telesurgery. They also discuss the importance of rapid deployment of new healthcare applications and services, as well as the use of 5G in supply chain management for healthcare, self-isolation monitoring, and contact tracing. The authors explore the role of 5G in addressing scalability and quality of service challenges, as well as implementation challenges related to privacy protection, security, limited connectivity, societal issues, and legal and regulatory considerations. Overall, the authors argue that 5G technology has the potential to significantly enhance healthcare services and mitigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is crucial to address the implementation challenges effectively.

## Summary of the article

The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has caused a lot of changes in our lives. One of the challenges is that hospitals are getting overwhelmed with sick patients, which means they can't take care of other health problems. To help with this, doctors are now using technology like video calls to talk to patients and give them advice. They can even perform surgeries using robots controlled by doctors in a different place. This way, patients can still get the help they need without having to go to the hospital. Another problem is that there is a shortage of important supplies like masks and medicine. With the help of technology like 5G, we can keep track of these supplies and make sure they get to the people who need them the most. Technology can also help us monitor people who are sick and make sure they are following the rules to stay isolated. However, there are some challenges like privacy and security that we need to solve before we can use this technology fully. Overall, technology like 5G can play a big role in helping us during the COVID-19 pandemic.
