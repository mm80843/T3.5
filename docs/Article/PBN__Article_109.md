# __COVID-19 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Threat to Solidarity or an Opportunity?__

## DOI of the article

10.3390/su12135343

## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, posing a threat to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The UN has launched a plan to combat the virus and build a better world, emphasizing the need for international solidarity and financial support for vulnerable nations. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of less industrialized countries, which may struggle to meet the SDGs. The economic impacts of COVID-19 are expected to be worse than those of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, with global recession and increased poverty predicted. The health, social, and environmental impacts of the pandemic are also significant, affecting SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, decent work, reduce inequalities, and peace and justice. The crisis has highlighted the underinvestment in healthcare systems and the fragility of social and healthcare systems worldwide. Populism and nationalism may undermine international solidarity and cooperation. However, the pandemic has also brought some positive changes, such as reduced emissions and increased digitalization. The long-term outlook and recovery from the pandemic are uncertain, and a strong commitment to the SDGs is needed to ensure progress is not hindered. Greater international solidarity and support for developing countries is crucial in addressing the impacts of COVID-19 and achieving the SDGs.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on the world. Many countries are struggling to meet the goals set by the United Nations to make the world a better place by 2030. The pandemic has made it even harder for less developed countries to achieve these goals. The UN is hopeful that with international cooperation and support, we can overcome the virus and work towards a better world. There is a lot of work to be done, especially in areas like ending poverty, ensuring everyone has enough to eat, and providing good healthcare and education for all. The pandemic has shown us that we need to take better care of our planet and work together to solve problems.
