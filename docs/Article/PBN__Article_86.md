This study aimed to review and analyze the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies for preventing or slowing down the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that social distancing measures, implemented in layers, can be effective in reducing the spread of infection. Early application of social distancing has been shown to be more effective than late implementation. It is important to establish an anticipated end date for these measures and prioritize mental well-being by promoting internet-based communication and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Global containment strategies, including travel restrictions and border control measures, have been effective in reducing disease transmission. The concept of herd immunity has been considered as a strategy, but it is challenging and requires strict control to prevent a disastrous epidemic. Mass testing is recommended to identify and isolate infected individuals, and it can be a more rapid and cost-effective approach compared to developing a vaccine. The compliance of the public with these mitigation strategies relies on building trust and transparency between healthcare authorities and the public. Overall, a combination of these strategies is crucial in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
