# __Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1__

## DOI of the article

10.1056/NEJMc2004973

## Short summary of the article

This study analyzed the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to SARS-CoV-1. The stability of the viruses was evaluated in aerosols and on various surfaces. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols for 3 hours, with a reduction in infectious titer similar to SARS-CoV-1. The viruses were more stable on plastic and stainless steel compared to copper and cardboard. Viable virus was detected up to 72 hours on plastic and 48 hours on stainless steel, although the virus titer was greatly reduced. On copper, no viable virus was measured after 4 hours, and on cardboard, no viable virus was measured after 24 hours. Both viruses showed an exponential decay in virus titer over time. The half-lives of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 were similar in aerosols, with longer half-lives observed on stainless steel and plastic. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar to SARS-CoV-1, indicating that differences in their epidemiologic characteristics arise from other factors.

## Summary of the article

There are two viruses called SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 that are similar to each other. Scientists wanted to see how these viruses can stay in the air and on different surfaces. They found that both viruses can stay in the air for about 3 hours, and they can stay on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours. However, they don't last very long on copper and cardboard surfaces. The viruses also become less powerful over time and their strength decreases. Overall, both viruses behave pretty similarly and their differences are because of other factors, not how long they can stay in the air or on surfaces.
