# __Scalable IoT Architecture for Monitoring IEQ Conditions in Public and Private Buildings__

## DOI of the article

10.3390/en15062270

## Short summary of the article

This research presents a scalable IoT architecture for monitoring indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in public and private buildings. The architecture consists of smart IEQ sensor nodes at the edge layer, which acquire IEQ parameters locally, and IEQ concentrators at the fog layer, which collect and analyze data from multiple sensor nodes. The architecture is designed to ensure thermal comfort, reduce energy consumption, and guarantee air quality. The system uses existing wireless communication infrastructure, such as WiFi, to transmit data, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy. The research also includes a prototype of the IEQ monitoring system, which uses low-cost open-source hardware and software. The prototype was tested in different scenarios, including staff offices, laboratories, and classrooms, and demonstrated positive performance results. Overall, the proposed architecture and prototype provide a practical solution for monitoring IEQ in buildings, contributing to sustainability and well-being.

## Summary of the article

The authors have created a system called the Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) monitoring system that helps monitor the conditions inside buildings. The system uses small devices called smart IEQ sensor nodes to measure things like temperature, humidity, and air quality. These devices are placed in different parts of the building to get accurate readings. The data collected by the sensor nodes is sent to a central device called the IEQ concentrator, which stores and analyzes the data. The system can help make buildings more energy-efficient and ensure the comfort and well-being of the people inside. The authors tested the system in different scenarios like offices, laboratories, and classrooms, and it worked well. In the future, they plan to improve the system further and use it in more buildings.
