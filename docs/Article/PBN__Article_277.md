## Short summary of the article

This paper examines the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the design of residential architecture and human behavior. It uses a qualitative approach with descriptive analysis methods to gather data through a literature study. The history of pandemics shows that architecture has always been influenced by infectious diseases. The Black Death pandemic introduced the concept of quarantine and the need for spacing between buildings. The tuberculosis pandemic led to the design of buildings with good air flow and sunlight exposure. The Covid-19 pandemic, with its rapid transmission and mutations, has led to various responses and adaptations worldwide, including the conversion of buildings into quarantine facilities and the implementation of health protocols. The digital era has allowed for remote work and education, making the house a multi-functional space. The paper discusses the need for infectious disease-friendly building designs and explores various adaptations in residential design during the pandemic. These adaptations include creating healthy homes with superior indoor air quality, water, and lighting, as well as providing spaces for work and study and independent isolation rooms. The use of hygienic and anti-bacterial materials, good ventilation, natural lighting, and outdoor spaces are also highlighted. The paper concludes that pandemics shape architecture and human needs, and designing for health and sustainability should be prioritized in the future.

## Summary of the article

During pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic we are experiencing now, it can change the way buildings and houses are designed. In the past, pandemics like the Black Death and tuberculosis also caused changes in building designs. For example, during the Black Death, they introduced the concept of quarantine, where sick people were kept separate from healthy people. During the tuberculosis pandemic, they realized fresh air and sunlight were important for treating the disease, so buildings were designed with big windows and open spaces. Now, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people are spending more time at home and using their homes for work, school, and other activities. This means houses need to be designed in a way that supports all these activities and keeps people safe from the virus.
