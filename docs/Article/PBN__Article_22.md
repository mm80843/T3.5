Respiratory viruses can cause a lot of sickness and sometimes even lead to death. They can spread quickly and affect a lot of people. Epidemics of these viruses can also have a big impact on the economy and people's daily lives. Scientists have been studying different ways to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses. They found that things like washing hands often, wearing masks and gloves, and keeping distance from others can help reduce the spread of these viruses. These measures are especially important for younger children. It is also important to educate people about these preventive measures and make sure they follow them.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This systematic review summarizes the evidence for the effectiveness of combined public health measures, such as personal hygiene, distancing, and barriers, in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses. The review focused on interventions to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses from animals to humans or from humans to humans. The authors excluded vaccines and antivirals because these have been reviewed separately. The review included trials and observational studies that controlled for confounding factors. The outcome measures included deaths, cases of viral illness, severity of illness, and burden measures such as hospital admissions. The review identified 51 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies varied and there were some limitations in reporting and study design. However, the review found that physical barriers, such as handwashing, wearing masks, and isolation are effective and relatively inexpensive interventions for reducing the spread of respiratory viruses, including SARS. The review also highlighted the importance of implementing these interventions in combination and providing instruction and education to maximize their effectiveness. Further large pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate the best combinations of interventions. In the meantime, the review recommends implementing frequent handwashing, wearing masks, gloves, gowns, and isolation of people with suspected respiratory tract infections to reduce viral transmission.
