During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that the conditions of our homes can affect our health and well-being. Many people in Italy live in overcrowded apartments that don't have enough space for everyone. These apartments also often have problems with things like damp walls and a lack of basic services like running water and heating. The lockdown made it even harder for people to stay healthy and safe in their homes, especially for those who live in more crowded and inadequate apartments. To make our homes healthier, we can focus on a few things. One important thing is to have green spaces and gardens around our homes, which can make us feel better and reduce the effects of hot weather. We also need to have flexible and adaptable living spaces that can easily change as our needs change. It's also important to have good ventilation and air quality in our homes, as well as good water and waste management. And finally, we should use materials in our homes that are safe and don't emit harmful chemicals.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the housing conditions in Italy and their impact on public health, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The study reveals that the average size of apartments in Italy is 117 m2, with Milan having the smallest average apartment size at 88 m2. Over one-third of apartments in Italy are below 60 m2, and 20.7% of overcrowded apartments housing more than 4 people measure less than 80 m2. In 2018, 28.8% of the population lived in overcrowded apartments. Additionally, many Italian apartments suffer from a lack of primary services and inadequate structural requirements. Almost 8 million people were living in apartments with damp walls, and many apartments lack running water, water heating, central heating, toilets, showers/bathtubs, and separate kitchens. Furthermore, 11.4% of apartments lacked balconies, terraces, or gardens. The research suggests that overcrowded and inadequately equipped apartments made it difficult for individuals to isolate during the lockdown, resulting in in-house transmission of the virus. The study highlights the need to rethink living spaces to protect the health and well-being of residents and provides recommendations for creating safe, healthy, and sustainable housing. These include the incorporation of visible and accessible green spaces, flexibility and adaptability in living spaces, and attention to thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The research also discusses the importance of water consumption and wastewater management, urban solid waste management, housing automation, and the use of indoor building materials. The researchers emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and a systematic approach to address the housing crisis in Italy.
