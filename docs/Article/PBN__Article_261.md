# __The Impact of COVID-19 on Public Space: A Review of the Emerging Questions__

## DOI of the article

10.31219/osf.io/rf7xa

## Short summary of the article

This article discusses the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public spaces, specifically focusing on their design, use, behaviors, and perceptions. It raises a series of questions related to how the pandemic may transform public spaces, such as whether streets will be redesigned to accommodate more pedestrians and cyclists, whether health criteria will be integrated into the design process, and whether there will be changes to the design and use of green spaces. The article also considers the future of large public spaces, the need for a new typology for public spaces, and the potential impacts on micro-mobility and public transit. It further explores how the pandemic may change what people do in public spaces, the intuitive carrying capacity of these spaces, and the use and regulation of interior spaces. The article also highlights concerns about potential infringements on civil liberties and changes in public perceptions of spaces. Finally, it addresses issues related to inequities and exclusions, such as the needs of vulnerable groups, the regulation of informal street economies, and the potential disruption of the global settlement system. The authors highlight the importance of monitoring and studying these changes to inform urban planning and design decisions for healthier and more inclusive cities.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions on the use of public spaces worldwide. Cities that were once bustling with activity are now empty as people stay home to prevent the spread of the virus. This has made us lose our vibrant and lively public spaces. We are uncertain about what the future holds and how our relationship with public space will change. There are many questions about how public spaces will be designed, used, and perceived. Some possibilities include re-designing streets, adding health criteria to public space design, and creating more green spaces. The pandemic may also impact large public gatherings and change what we do in public. It may also raise issues of inequity and exclusion, such as the needs of vulnerable groups and the regulation of informal street economies. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a significant impact on our public spaces, but it is not yet clear exactly how things will change.
