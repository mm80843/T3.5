This paper provides a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of previous research on pandemic mitigation strategies and discusses the considerable research publications on COVID-19. The authors highlight the importance of strengthening public health and hygiene, as well as implementing measures such as tracking and tracing transmissions, mass testing, social distancing, and vaccine formulation. The review examines the economic and social impact of pandemics, and emphasizes the need for strong and rapid domestic and global preparedness to stop the spread and spark risk. The reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 is compared to other pandemics, and the authors propose a conceptual strategic framework and various protocols for monitoring and controlling the spread of COVID-19. They also suggest the use of innovative technologies, such as cloud-based tracing and tracking systems, QR codes for identification and testing, and offshore medical rigs. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of long-term strategies, technological advancements, and interdisciplinary collaboration in mitigating the current crisis and preparing for future pandemics.

Pandemics, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, can cause a lot of harm to the economy and people's health. In the past, there have been other pandemics, like the 1918 influenza pandemic, that caused a lot of deaths. Some pandemics started from animals and then spread to humans, like the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to be prepared for a pandemic by having plans to test and trace the virus, practice social distancing, and develop vaccines. Pandemics also have a big impact on the economy and people's lives, causing shortages of medical equipment and mental stress. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person to person and is harder to contain compared to other viruses like SARS. Researchers have studied different strategies to mitigate the spread of pandemics and have developed a framework to guide governments and healthcare systems in responding to future pandemics. It is important to continue researching and preparing for pandemics, as they can still happen in the future.
