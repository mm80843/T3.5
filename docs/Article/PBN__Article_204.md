This research abstract summarizes a paper that discusses the importance of biomedical application ontologies in representing pandemics and infectious diseases. The paper begins by providing background information on ontology and the different types of ontologies. It then focuses on the state-of-the-art ontologies developed for representing earlier infectious diseases and pandemics, including MERS, COVID-19, malaria, influenza-like illness, brucellosis, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, meningitis, and swine flu. The ontologies are described in terms of their development process, tools used, and evaluation methods. The paper concludes by acknowledging the importance of developing ontologies that model multiple diseases and promoting their use in controlling and monitoring pandemics. The abstract highlights the significance of ontologies in sharing and communicating consensual knowledge about infectious diseases and encourages further development in this area.

The text talks about something called ontologies, which are like special vocabulary lists that help people understand and communicate about diseases. They are very important when it comes to dangerous and contagious diseases like Influenza, Malaria, and COVID-19. The text also mentions different types of ontologies, like ones for specific tasks or specific domains (like health or education). It explains that developing ontologies can help scientists and doctors share knowledge and find solutions for diseases. It also talks about some existing ontologies that have been made for different diseases, like COVID-19.
