This research paper explores the implementation of emerging technologies (ETs) and open government (OG) projects in smart cities for effective governance and disaster management, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for more efficient and adaptable public management models that can effectively respond to crises. The decision-making processes in crisis response efforts have been found to be both centralized and decentralized, with no clear evidence of the best approach. ETs, such as big data, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to support strategic planning and decision-making in disaster management. Open government initiatives, particularly open data projects, have become increasingly important for successful disaster management. Collaborative and alignment strategic planning processes, as well as the use of geospatial mapping and ETs, can help in preventing, identifying, and mitigating the effects of health pandemics like COVID-19. The implementation of ETs and OG projects can contribute to the development of innovative governance models that are more inclusive, transparent, and responsive to the needs of citizens. The research suggests that there is a need for further studies on these topics to improve urban resilience and strategic planning processes.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a lot of problems for society, like economic issues and challenges for governments. It has shown that governments need to be better at handling emergencies like this. One way they can improve is by using new technologies, like big data and artificial intelligence, to make better decisions. These technologies can help with things like tracking the virus, planning for emergencies, and sharing information with the public. Some cities are already using these technologies to become "smart cities" and improve their services. It's important for governments to work together and involve citizens in the decision-making process to create better solutions for future disasters.
