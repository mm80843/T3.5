# __Compliance with COVID-19 Mitigation Measures in the United States__

## DOI of the article

10.31234/osf.io/qymu3

## Short summary of the article

This study examines compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures in the United States, focusing on social distancing and staying at home. The research analyzes the extent to which people have complied with the measures and the factors that shape compliance. The results show that self-reported compliance has been relatively high, with most people indicating that they comply almost always. Specific moral alignment, negative emotions, and impulsivity are associated with higher compliance, while perceived threat, support for current policies, and costs of compliance are unrelated to compliance. Descriptive social norms, practical capacity to comply, and opportunity to violate the measures are all significant factors influencing compliance. Additionally, non-normative obligation to obey the law is negatively associated with compliance, indicating that fear of authorities decreases compliance. Political orientation is not associated with compliance. The study provides insights for policymakers in sustaining compliance and highlights the need for continued monitoring of compliance levels and factors that influence compliance over time.

## Summary of the article

This study looked at how people in the US have been following the rules to stay at home and practice social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers wanted to find out what factors influenced people's compliance with these measures. They found that most people reported that they were following the rules most of the time. People who believed it was important for everyone to follow the rules and those who had negative emotions about the pandemic were more likely to comply. People who were impulsive and had more opportunities to break the rules were less likely to comply. The study also found that trust in science and the media, as well as political orientation, did not have a significant impact on compliance. Overall, it shows that compliance with the COVID-19 measures in the US has been high so far, but different factors can influence whether people follow the rules or not.
