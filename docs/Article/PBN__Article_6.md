In this study, researchers looked at how different aspects of cities can affect the spread of diseases like COVID-19. They studied four key factors: urban density and crowding, urban mobility, urban activities, and urban inequality. They found that high residential building density, which means more people living close together, can actually be good for pandemic resilience. However, crowded buildings and rooms can increase the risk of infection. They also found that long commute times on public transportation can increase the risk of spreading the virus. The study suggested that cities should focus on things like mixed land use, shorter commute times, and access to essential services like grocery stores and parks to make them more resilient to future pandemics.

This research abstract summarizes a study that examines the relationship between the urban built environment and the transmission of infectious diseases, specifically focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. The study discusses four key urban design attributes (KUDA) categories - urban density and crowding, urban mobility, urban activities, and urban inequality - and their influence on COVID-19 case rates in New York City (NYC). The study analyzes data from various sources, including the US Census Bureau, NYC Department of City Planning, and Google Maps Platform, to investigate the impact of these design attributes on COVID-19 transmission. The findings suggest that high residential building density is advantageous for pandemic resilience, while building-level crowding and long public transit commute times are unfavorable. The study also highlights the importance of accessible urban amenities, such as shopping malls and parks, in mitigating infection rates. Additionally, it emphasizes the disparities and vulnerabilities faced by low-income and marginalized communities in dense urban areas. The study provides insights for urban design and planning strategies to build resilient and inclusive cities in the face of future pandemics.
