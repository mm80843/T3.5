## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus. This is called a social lockdown. The virus, called CoV-19, is very contagious and can make people very sick. It spreads when a healthy person comes in contact with an infected person or an object that has the virus on it. People with weak immune systems or other health problems are at a higher risk of getting very sick from the virus. Social lockdowns have helped reduce the pollution in the air and water, and wild animals have been able to move around freely. It's important to follow social lockdown rules to keep ourselves and the environment safe.

## Short summary of the article

This review article explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social lockdown measures implemented to control its spread on the environment. The virus, known as CoV-19, has spread to 210 countries and is caused by a mutated form of the coronavirus. The symptoms of the disease include dry cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. The virus primarily spreads through close contact with infected individuals or objects carrying the virus. Lockdown measures, which restrict mass movement and interaction, have been implemented as the only preventive measure against the virus, as there are currently no specific medicines or vaccines available. The review discusses how social lockdowns have led to a reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, resulting in cleaner air and improved air quality in many cities. It also highlights the positive effects of the lockdown on wildlife and biodiversity, with animals reclaiming urban areas and water bodies becoming cleaner. The article emphasizes the need for continued efforts to protect the environment and suggests that regular interval lockdowns and changes in human behavior could contribute to long-term environmental sustainability.
