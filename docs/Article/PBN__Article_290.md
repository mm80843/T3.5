This research abstract summarizes the importance of green buildings in improving occupant health and wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis has affected global economies and has been primarily transmitted through person-to-person contact and contact with surfaces. Green buildings, with their energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, water efficiency, sustainable materials, site management, innovation, and commissioning, can play a vital role in protecting individuals from harmful toxins. People spend a significant amount of time indoors, and the built environment has a profound impact on their overall health and well-being. Factors such as poor air quality, stress, and improper food choices can affect the occupants' health, happiness, and productivity. Building wellness emphasizes the transformation of indoor spaces to prioritize the health and wellness of the inhabitants, including improved nutrition, fitness, mood, and sleep patterns. Rethinking buildings and incorporating state-of-the-art ventilation systems, green retrofitting, and adequate daylighting can help create healthier and safer spaces in response to the post-COVID-19 environment. Green buildings are seen as a catalyst for creating a healthy world and can contribute to slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic through non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Buildings have a big impact on our health and well-being, especially now with the coronavirus. The virus spreads through the air when someone coughs or sneezes, and also by touching surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching our face. We spend a lot of time indoors, so it's important to have healthy buildings. Green buildings are like giant facemasks that protect us from harmful things inside. Green buildings have things like good air quality, energy efficiency, and use sustainable materials. It's important to make sure new buildings have good ventilation and to make older buildings healthier too. Healthy buildings play a big role in creating a healthy world for everyone.
