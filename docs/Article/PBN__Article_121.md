## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the significance of airborne transmission of viruses, focusing on the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the need for additional methods to reduce the risk of transmission, particularly in healthcare facilities. Several hospital-based studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples, indicating a potential risk of airborne transmission. Three studies provided quantitative data on viral RNA concentrations, with one study finding a range of viral loads in air samples of patient infection isolation rooms. The abstract argues that SARS-CoV-2 should be treated similarly to other respiratory viruses that are recognized to be transmissible via the airborne route. Ventilation is identified as a critical factor in reducing airborne transmission, and recommendations are provided for enhancing ventilation systems in indoor environments. The use of air cleaning and disinfection devices, such as germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) systems, is also highlighted as a beneficial measure. The abstract concludes that implementing these engineering controls can help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne infectious agents. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the importance of airborne transmission and the potential strategies for mitigating its risks.

## Summary of the article

Ventilation is really important in buildings and hospitals because it helps to remove the air that might have the virus in it. There are different ways that viruses can spread, like through droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, or when you touch something that has the virus on it. But there is also a chance that the virus can spread through very small droplets in the air, called aerosols. Some studies have found evidence that the virus can be in the air and spread through these tiny droplets. So, it's important to have good ventilation and clean air in buildings to help reduce the risk of getting sick. There are also other things that can be done, like using air cleaners and disinfection devices, and limiting the number of people in a room or building to help reduce the spread of the virus.
