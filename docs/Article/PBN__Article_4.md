# __Mapping research in logistics and supply chain management during COVID-19 pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.1080/13675567.2021.1958768

## Short summary of the article

This research article presents a systematic literature review of papers published during the COVID-19 pandemic on disruption management in supply chains. The authors identify the challenges faced by supply chains during the pandemic, including disruptions in production and distribution, changes in demand patterns, and the need for collaboration and agility. They propose a conceptual framework to analyze and prepare supply chains for future disruptions, considering the characteristics of individual organizations, the structure of the supply chain, performance metrics for sustainability, and the attributes of external disruptions. The paper also highlights the importance of addressing social and environmental dimensions in supply chain performance evaluation. The authors identify research gaps and suggest future avenues for research, such as collaboration, technology adoption, and the use of scenario planning. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of supply chain management during the COVID-19 pandemic and provides a framework for decision-making in future disruptions.

## Summary of the article

In this article, the authors discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected supply chains around the world. They explain that supply chains have become more volatile due to globalization and pressure from lean manufacturing. They also mention that end consumers have changed their buying habits, leading to disruptions in the supply chain. The authors suggest that supply chain managers need to be proactive in dealing with these disruptions and that a fully interdisciplinary approach is needed. They also propose a framework for managing disruptions in supply chains and identify areas for future research.
