## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract summarizes the effect and role of environmental factors in buildings, spatial dynamics, and building operational factors in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The study provides an overview of the environmental factors involved in the persistence and spread of the virus, including air temperature and humidity, sunlight, and stability on surfaces. It also highlights the possible pathways of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including droplet and contact transmission, and the potential for close-contact aerosol transmission in confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environments. The abstract discusses the importance of adequate control measures, such as ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, in preventing the spread of the virus in building environments. It also discusses the recommendations and guidelines provided by the Japanese ministries for indoor environmental quality control to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments and implementing appropriate control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In this article, the authors discuss the factors that contribute to the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in indoor environments, such as buildings. They explain that the virus can survive on surfaces like plastic and metal for several days, and it can also remain in the air as small particles called aerosols for hours. The authors suggest that the virus can be transmitted between people through close contact and respiratory droplets, but also through the air if the space is poorly ventilated. They recommend measures like proper ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to reduce the risk of transmission in buildings. The authors also mention some real-life examples where outbreaks occurred in indoor spaces, like restaurants and call centers, and discuss the importance of ventilation in preventing the spread of the virus.
