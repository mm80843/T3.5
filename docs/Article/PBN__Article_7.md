# __The City Under COVID‐19: Podcasting As Digital Methodology__

## Short summary of the article

This critical commentary focuses on a podcast project that collected audio recordings from 25 urban scholars around the world about their experience in their respective cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aimed to explore the impacts of the pandemic on cities and to better understand the experiences of urban residents. The podcasting methodology used in the project involved planning and production of the podcast as well as iterative critical reflections on the process and content. The methodology extended existing qualitative methodologies by incorporating oral and aural data alongside text. The podcast project revealed insights about the soundscape of cities under COVID-19, the dynamics of selfishness and solidarity, and the presence and absence of people in urban spaces. The commentary also reflects on the collaborative writing process that accompanied the podcast production, highlighting discussions about positionality, privilege, and power. The commentary emphasizes the need for critical reflexivity in podcasting methodologies and suggests future research to address the power dynamics in the podcasting process.

## Summary of the article

A group of 25 researchers from different countries recorded audio reports about how their cities were being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. They made these recordings on their phones and turned them into a podcast. The podcast talked about how the pandemic was changing cities, with some places becoming quieter and people hearing birds they hadn't noticed before. The researchers also talked about how some people were being selfish, like hoarding toilet paper, while others were showing solidarity by helping each other out. The podcast helped people hear different perspectives from around the world and think about what was happening in cities during the pandemic.
