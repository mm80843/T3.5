Covid-19 is a global pandemic that is affecting people all over the world. It is a disease that spreads easily and can make people very sick, especially older people or those with other health problems. Because of Covid-19, we have to be careful and follow rules to protect ourselves and others, like washing our hands and keeping our distance from other people. The virus has also affected how we use public spaces, like parks and markets. Some places have had to make changes to keep people safe, like marking out spaces for people to stand and keeping crowds small. Architects and designers are also thinking about how to make buildings and cities safer for the future. They are considering things like wider sidewalks, more green spaces, and better transportation options. We need to be prepared for future pandemics and make sure our cities and buildings can keep us safe.
