# __Association between indoor-outdoor green features and psychological health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: A cross-sectional nationwide study__

## Short summary of the article

This study investigates the associations between indoor and outdoor green features in the home environment and self-reported changes in psychological health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. The study used an online survey to collect data from over 3800 participants. The results showed that the presence of indoor plant pots and sunlight in the home was associated with a lower increase in anxiety, anger, fear, and sleep disturbance. A greater amount of green view from the home and accessibility to private green spaces were also associated with a lower increase in psychological health outcomes. Living on a road with higher levels of greenness was associated with a lower increase in all psychological health outcomes. The findings suggest that green features within and around the home environment can play a protective role in maintaining psychological well-being during lockdowns and restrictions. The study highlights the importance of incorporating nature-based elements in the design of indoor and outdoor spaces to promote mental health. Future research should explore the long-term effects of green features on psychological health and consider other potential mediating factors.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when people had to stay at home, researchers wanted to know how the presence of nature inside and outside homes affected people's mental health. They conducted a survey on a large group of people in Italy. They found that having plants inside the house was associated with lower feelings of anger, fear, and sleep problems. Having sunlight in the house was also linked to lower levels of anger, fear, and sleep problems. Being able to see green spaces from the window and having access to private green spaces were both associated with lower levels of all the negative emotions they studied. The researchers think that being surrounded by nature, even just inside the house, can help make people happier and less stressed during difficult times like a lockdown.
