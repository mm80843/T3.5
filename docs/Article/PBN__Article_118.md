# __Current knowledge of COVID-19: Advances, challenges and future perspectives__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.bsheal.2021.06.001

## Short summary of the article

This review article provides a summary of current knowledge on various aspects of COVID-19, including the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its cell entry mechanisms, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis. The review discusses the potential animal hosts of the virus, such as bats and pangolins, and highlights the need to identify the "Patient Zero" to better understand the emergence of the virus. The article also explores the different receptors and factors involved in virus entry into host cells, as well as the organ systems affected by COVID-19, including the respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and central nervous system. Additionally, the review examines population susceptibility to the virus, with a focus on age, gender, and blood type. The article also discusses key factors contributing to the transmission of the virus, such as close contact, respiratory droplets, and surface contamination, and highlights the importance of vaccines and drugs in combating the disease. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for ongoing surveillance of coronaviruses and the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and universal vaccines to prepare for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases.

## Summary of the article

Scientists have been studying COVID-19 to find out where it comes from and how it affects our bodies. They think the virus may have come from bats, but they're not sure yet. Some other animals, like pangolins and salmon, can also get similar viruses. They're studying these animals to help make vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The virus can enter our cells through a special protein and can affect different parts of our body, not just our lungs. Older people and men are more likely to get sick from the virus. It spreads from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and talking, so it's important to wear masks and wash our hands. Scientists are also working on developing vaccines and medicines to treat COVID-19. In the future, we need to keep studying viruses and be prepared for new ones to keep us safe.
