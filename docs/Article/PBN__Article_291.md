This research study examines the impact of non-contact interaction on urban community planning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses on the changes in residents' behavior and needs before, during, and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on the city of Hangzhou, China. The study finds that non-contact interaction, facilitated by the internet and information technology, has significantly changed residents' lifestyles and needs. The impact of non-contact interaction on different types of community service facilities varies, with some facilities experiencing significant changes while others remain relatively unaffected. There is also a significant spatial scale effect, with different impacts observed in different community life circles. Based on the findings, the study proposes a model for configuring composite space service facilities in communities in the post-pandemic period, aiming to promote the sustainable development of urban communities. The study concludes that integrating virtual and physical space is crucial for community planning and the provision of high-quality community services.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people had to stay at home and avoid close contact with others to stay safe. This changed the way people used community services like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers. Many people started using online services instead, like online classes and online doctor consultations. This showed that virtual interactions, where we can communicate without being face-to-face, became really important during the pandemic. It also showed that communities need to think about how to provide these virtual services to people. Different types of services were affected differently, and it also depended on how close people lived to these services. So, in the future, community planning should consider both physical spaces and virtual spaces to make sure people have the services they need.
