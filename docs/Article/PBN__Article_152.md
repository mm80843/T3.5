# __Epidemics, Planning and the City: A Special Issue of Planning Perspectives__

## Summary of the article

The coronavirus pandemic has made people think about how cities can be designed in the future to prevent the spread of diseases. Measures like social distancing have changed the way we use public spaces and buildings. During lockdowns, people had to stay inside their homes, but now that restrictions are easing, public spaces are becoming important again. People are discussing whether densely populated cities are a good idea for preventing pandemics. There are also examples of how cities have adapted to deal with disease outbreaks in the past, like building hospitals and vaccination centers. Overall, it's important to learn from history and make sure that cities are designed in ways that keep people healthy and safe.

## Short summary of the article

This editorial discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cities and the implications for future urban development. The implementation of social distancing measures has altered the use and nature of workspaces, schools, and leisure spaces, prompting discussions about the future of land-use planning and urban design. The pandemic has also influenced the role of the home as a hub for domestic, caring, and professional activities, raising questions about the future of domestic architecture and neighborhood design. As restrictions are easing, public spaces have become focal points for urban life, highlighting the potential future development of open-air cities. There is a debate about the compatibility of pandemic-proof cities with high-density buildings and public transport networks. The growth in medical activities, such as testing, vaccinations, and isolation, has led to the creation of new typologies, including mass vaccination centers and pop-up hospitals, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in urban planning. The historical context of infectious disease outbreaks, such as cholera, plague, and influenza, is explored, highlighting the role of planning in responding to public health threats. The special issue aims to examine how planning has constructed the challenge of epidemics and developed strategies to contain and treat them. The interplay of various factors, such as environmental, social, and cultural, shape the emergence and spread of diseases. The papers in this special issue focus on specific epidemics throughout history and their impact on urban planning. Topics include the role of planning in combating cholera and yellow fever in Buenos Aires, the impact of malaria on military cantonments in British colonial India, the response to the Spanish influenza pandemic in Bombay, and the influence of tuberculosis on town planning in South Australia. Other papers discuss the effects of hypochondriac fears in planning in British Africa, the role of epidemics in the development of Madrid's urban governance, the transformation of Dublin's food markets in response to disease spread, and the geopolitical dimensions of COVID-19 in Jerusalem, Phnom Penh, and Toronto. The papers underscore the contingency of urban planning on medical theory and knowledge, and the potential for planning interventions to exacerbate social inequalities. They highlight the need for future urban planning to consider political contexts and their impacts on health outcomes.
