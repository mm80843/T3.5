There is a type of virus called coronaviruses that can make people sick, and the one we're dealing with right now is called COVID-19. This virus has a structure with spike proteins that look like a crown. Scientists have been using different engineering techniques to try and fight against this virus. One technique is using UV light, which can damage the genetic material of the virus and stop it from spreading. Another technique is using infrared cameras to measure people's body temperatures and identify if they have a fever, which is a symptom of COVID-19. Robots are also being used to help with tasks like taking temperatures and delivering things to reduce the contact between people. Lastly, face recognition technology can help track and identify people who might be infected. All of these techniques are being used to try and control the spread of the virus and keep people safe.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This study provides an overview of engineering techniques that have been used to combat the spread of COVID-19. It discusses the use of UV light radiation for disinfection, highlighting the different subsets of UV radiation and their effects on microorganisms. The study also explores the use of infrared thermal imaging (thermography) for temperature screening, particularly in crowded areas, public buildings, and medical facilities. It emphasizes the advantages of thermal imaging, such as non-contact measurements and rapid scanning capabilities. Additionally, the study examines the role of robotics in reducing direct contact between healthcare workers and patients, including tasks such as temperature measurement, monitoring clinical parameters, and disinfection. The use of automated face recognition (AFR) technology for identification and verification is also discussed, with potential applications in tracking infected individuals and enforcing social distancing measures. Overall, the study highlights the importance of utilizing these engineering techniques to manage and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
