## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study on the perception of teleworking during the Covid-19 pandemic in Medellin, Colombia. The study used a quantitative approach and surveyed 1,300 adults who were currently teleworking. The results showed that the majority of respondents had a positive perception of teleworking, with women having a more favorable opinion compared to men. The study found that teleworking allowed for more interaction with family, increased physical activity, and improved air quality by reducing commuting. However, some respondents felt that teleworking was less efficient and did not result in a higher salary. The study also found that teleworking improved the working environment and quality of life. The results suggest that teleworking can have various benefits for individuals and companies, but it also presents challenges such as ensuring adequate work conditions and addressing potential negative impacts on health and well-being.

## Summary of the article

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, many people have been working from home using their computers and the internet. This is called telecommuting or teleworking. It has both advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages include being able to spend more time with family, having a more flexible schedule, and saving money on transportation. It also helps the environment because people don't have to drive to work. However, there can be some challenges like feeling isolated or having difficulty separating work and personal life. Overall, teleworking has become more common during the pandemic and may continue to be an option for people in the future.
