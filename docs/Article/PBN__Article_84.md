# __Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Saudi Arabia__

## Summary of the article

In Saudi Arabia, the COVID-19 virus started spreading in March 2020, and by October 2020, there were more than 300,000 confirmed cases and almost 5,000 deaths. The government took many actions to try to stop the spread of the virus, like closing schools, stopping international travel, and implementing curfews. They also did a lot of testing to identify people who had the virus. The actions they took seemed to help reduce the spread of the virus, but it's hard to know for sure how effective each action was because they were done at the same time. Overall, it's important to keep following safety measures like wearing masks and washing hands to stay safe from the virus.

## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to estimate the association between non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Saudi Arabia from March to October 2020. The study used a spatial SEIR-type model to analyze regional-level data on daily cases and deaths. NPIs implemented in Saudi Arabia included travel bans, school closures, isolation and testing measures, restrictions on public and private gatherings, domestic travel bans, curfews, and lockdowns. The model estimated the basic reproductive number (R0) and the effectiveness of different NPIs. The results showed that the effectiveness of NPIs varied among different interventions and regions. The NPIs associated with the greatest reductions in transmission were isolate and test with school closure, curfew, and lockdown. However, there was considerable uncertainty in the estimates. The study also found that the effective reproductive number (Reff) was close to the critical threshold in most regions at the end of the study period. The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of NPIs implemented in Saudi Arabia during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results may not apply to future effectiveness or to the current situation with vaccination and new variants.
