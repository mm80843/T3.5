# __Learning from pandemics: Applying resilience thinking to identify priorities for planning urban settlements__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a comprehensive study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban settlements and the planning strategies to improve resilience in the face of disease outbreaks. The study utilizes the concept of resilience and analyzes various aspects including disease transmission, vulnerability, environmental quality, response diversity, and social adaptive capacity within urban systems. The findings highlight the importance of reducing wildlife urban interfaces and improving food systems planning to minimize disease emergence and transmission.
Access to critical infrastructures such as water and shelter is crucial to reducing vulnerability and curbing disease transmission. Environmental quality, including air and water pollution, can exacerbate the incidence and severity of diseases. The study emphasizes the need for redundancy in supply chains and operations to prevent shortages and strengthen resilience. Furthermore, participatory governance structures and the cultivation of social capital are vital for building adaptive capacity and responding effectively to shocks.
The abstract also discusses the integration of complex systems and resilience theory in public health and urban planning. It recognizes the interconnectedness of macro and micro factors and emphasizes the role of planning in addressing the unequal distribution of disease in society. The abstract concludes by highlighting the need for comprehensive planning strategies that reduce shocks, stresses, vulnerability, and enhance redundancy and social adaptive capacity in urban settlements.

## Summary of the article

This text is about how diseases like COVID-19 can affect cities and what we need to do to make our cities more resilient to these diseases. The text talks about how diseases can spread from animals to humans and how human activities like urbanization and farming can make it easier for diseases to spread. It also talks about how access to things like clean water and housing can make a difference in preventing the spread of diseases. The text suggests that we need to reduce contact between wild animals and humans, improve access to critical infrastructures like water and shelter, improve environmental quality, have backup plans in case of shortages, and have good governance and community involvement to respond to diseases. These are all important things to consider when planning our cities to make sure they are safe and healthy for everyone.
