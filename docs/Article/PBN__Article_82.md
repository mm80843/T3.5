Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new and serious illness caused by a virus that started in Wuhan, China. It quickly spread around the world and became a global pandemic. The virus spreads when people cough or breathe out droplets, which can land on things and infect other people. It can make people really sick, especially those who already have medical problems. But anyone, no matter their age or health, can get the virus and get sick. To slow down the spread of the virus, governments had to make rules like closing down businesses and telling people to stay home. This made the construction industry, which builds things like houses and buildings, slow down and even stop sometimes. Construction workers had to follow special rules to stay safe, but some workers complained that their bosses were not doing enough to protect them. To help fix these concerns, experts made a list of 100 recommendations for construction companies to follow to keep their workers safe during the pandemic. These recommendations include things like wearing masks, staying far apart from each other, and cleaning everything often.

This study analyzed construction-related complaints submitted to the OSHA Complaint Tracker from March 2020 to January 2021 to understand the health and safety concerns of construction workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The complaints were categorized into themes such as personnel testing positive and continuing to work, lack of enforcement of social distancing and provision of masks and PPE, inadequate hand-washing facilities, lack of adherence to safety guidelines, and failure to disinfect the workplace. Based on these concerns, 100 best practices were identified from guidelines provided by OSHA, CDC, and AGC. The practices covered themes including access points, communication and awareness, compliance, daily tasks and activities, engineering controls, exposure response plan, human interactions, hygiene and sanitization, management of deliveries, physical and mental health, and safety wearables and carry-ons. The study provides insights into the concerns of construction workers and offers recommendations to address these concerns and improve health and safety on construction sites during the pandemic. Future research can assess the effectiveness of these practices and how the situation evolves as vaccines are rolled out.
