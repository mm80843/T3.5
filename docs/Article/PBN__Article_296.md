Wearable devices like smartwatches and activity trackers can help detect COVID-19 before you even have symptoms. These devices can measure things like your heart rate and how many steps you take each day. Researchers found that changes in these measurements can show if you might have COVID-19. One study looked at data from 32 people who tested positive for the virus, and they found that most of them showed abnormal heart rate patterns a few days before they had symptoms. Another study found that combining heart rate data with other symptoms can help detect COVID-19. These devices can be really helpful in future pandemics too. They might even be able to monitor how well someone is recovering from an illness.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

Wearable electronic devices have the potential to detect asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases of COVID-19 by continuously monitoring physiological signals. Two studies highlighted in this article demonstrate the effectiveness of using smartwatch data to identify individuals with COVID-19. In one study, researchers analyzed the data from infected individuals and found that elevated resting heart rates and increased heart rates relative to the number of steps could detect COVID-19 cases up to 7 days before the onset of symptoms. Another study combined smartwatch data with self-reported symptoms and achieved a higher accuracy in identifying COVID-19 cases. However, these detection methods have limitations including the inability to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral infections and the reliance on large datasets for training algorithms. Future developments in wearable sensors, such as electronic tattoos, contact lenses, textiles, and patches, could provide additional physical and biochemical signals for more accurate diagnostics. These emerging technologies could be used in future pandemics to identify symptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases and remotely monitor the recovery of individuals undergoing treatment or self-isolating at home. However, there are challenges related to data security, ethics, and regulation that need to be addressed. With further innovation and development, wearable sensors have the potential to play a crucial role in fighting future pandemics.
