The study focused on finding ways to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in buildings. Researchers conducted an international survey using a questionnaire to collect data from April to July 2020. The questionnaire asked about different methods to prevent the spread of the virus, such as training protocols, measures in operation and maintenance, and measures in design and construction. The data analysis showed that all methods had a positive effect in all types of buildings, but the effectiveness varied depending on the type of building. Training protocols and design and construction measures had the greatest impact on high-risk buildings, while measures in operation and maintenance had the greatest impact on medium-risk buildings. Overall, the study emphasized the importance of using prevention techniques in building design to control the spread of diseases like COVID-19.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research study aims to identify effective control and mitigation measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the built environment. A survey questionnaire was conducted internationally, collecting data from April to July 2020. The questionnaire focused on various prevention and control measures for buildings at risk of exposure to the coronavirus. The results showed that all methods had a positive effect in all types of buildings. However, the effectiveness varied depending on the type of building. Training protocols and measures in design and construction had the greatest impact in high and very high-risk buildings, while measures in operation and maintenance had the greatest impact in medium-risk buildings. In low-risk buildings, all methods had similar effects. The study concluded that utilizing prevention techniques in the design and construction of buildings is one way to control the spread of COVID-19. These findings can inform decision-making and planning in facilities management to reduce the transmission of the virus in different types of buildings.
