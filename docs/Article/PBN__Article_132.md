This research abstract focuses on the global policy challenges and approaches to address urban vector-borne disease (VBD) risks. It highlights that poor urban communities are the most vulnerable to VBDs, such as the spread of Zika virus in low- and middle-income countries due to factors like urban crowding, poor housing, and inadequate water and waste management. The UN-Habitat agency seeks to influence urban growth through improved planning and provision of infrastructure to reduce VBD transmission. Community participation and outreach are critical in mitigating epidemics, as evidenced by efforts to reduce the spread of dengue virus. Embedding health-related indicators in the post-2015 sustainable development goals can raise awareness about the health gains from sustainable development policies. Urban sprawl is detrimental to health due to high costs of service provision and decreased access to healthcare facilities. Enhanced surveillance and mosquito control measures are crucial in addressing urban VBD risks. Investment in improving water storage, sanitation, and housing in low-income areas is necessary. The long-term control strategy should focus on addressing urban poverty and developing indicators that emphasize health as a precondition for sustainable urban development.

Urbanization is when more and more people move to live in cities. But it can also bring some bad things, like diseases that are spread by bugs called vectors. Examples of these diseases are Zika and dengue fever. Poor communities in cities are more vulnerable to these diseases because they live in crowded and dirty places. To help fight against these diseases, it's important to involve the community and have better city planning, like having clean water and good waste management. Also, it's important to have good healthcare and proper housing for everyone. Finally, we need to keep an eye on the spread of these diseases and control the mosquitoes that carry them.
