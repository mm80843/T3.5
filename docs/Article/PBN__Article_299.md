During the pandemic, there was a lot of information going around about which medicines were good or bad for COVID-19. The French Minister of Health said that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen might make the infection worse, so people should take acetaminophen instead. Many people believed this and started sharing it on social media. But when experts looked for evidence, they couldn't find any articles supporting this claim. It turned out to be inaccurate information. The same thing happened with warnings about ACE inhibitors and sartans. Sometimes, even experts can get things wrong and spread false information. It's important to be careful and make sure the information we share is backed by evidence.
