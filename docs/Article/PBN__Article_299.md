## DOI of the article

10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000713

## Short summary of the article

This article discusses the spread of misinformation and inaccurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights a tweet by the French Minister of Health recommending against the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, which gained widespread attention and support. However, no scientific articles were found to support this claim. The article also mentions conflicting information about the use of ACE inhibitors and sartans in relation to COVID-19. The author questions the cause of this misinformation and suggests that physicians may rely too heavily on their own expertise and may not always interpret data correctly. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of reliable information and individual responsibility in the scientific community, particularly in the age of social media.

## Summary of the article

During the pandemic, there was a lot of information going around about which medicines were good or bad for COVID-19. The French Minister of Health said that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen might make the infection worse, so people should take acetaminophen instead. Many people believed this and started sharing it on social media. But when experts looked for evidence, they couldn't find any articles supporting this claim. It turned out to be inaccurate information. The same thing happened with warnings about ACE inhibitors and sartans. Sometimes, even experts can get things wrong and spread false information. It's important to be careful and make sure the information we share is backed by evidence.
