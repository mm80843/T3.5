This paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost COVID-19 digital signage player that supports fever detection, face mask detection, and QR code check-in functionalities. The player is an Android-based standalone device that does not require server communication. It consists of an LCD panel, an embedded board with the RK3399 processor, and a webcam module for optical image capture. The player also includes a thermopile sensor module for infrared image capture. The proposed system utilizes the BlazeFace algorithm for face detection and an open-source algorithm for face mask detection. For temperature measurement, the system calculates the average temperature of the face region in the infrared images. The system also incorporates a QR code scanning module for check-in purposes. Experimental results demonstrate the successful operation of the proposed system in detecting faces, detecting face masks, measuring body temperature, and checking QR codes. The system is shown to have satisfactory performance in terms of accuracy and functionality.

In this text, the author talks about a device called a COVID-19 digital signage player that can help with detecting fever, checking if people are wearing masks, and scanning QR codes for contact tracing. The device uses infrared sensors to measure body temperature and detect faces and masks. It also has a camera to scan QR codes. The device is designed to be used in places like stores and theaters to not only perform these functions but also display advertisements. The author explains the theory behind infrared sensors and how they work. They also mention some previous research on face detection and mask detection using deep learning algorithms. Finally, they discuss the design and implementation of their proposed digital signage player and present some test results.
