## Summary of the article

The coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, is a sickness caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. It started in China in December 2019 and has spread to many countries around the world. The virus can be transmitted in two ways: directly and indirectly. Direct transmission happens when people breathe in tiny particles called aerosols that contain the virus, or when they touch body fluids like saliva or urine from an infected person. Indirect transmission happens when people touch surfaces that have the virus on them, like furniture or objects used by an infected person. The virus can also be found in other body fluids and secretions like tears, semen, and feces. To prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes, and wear face masks. Social distancing, which means staying at least 1 meter away from other people, is also important. Medical professionals need to wear protective equipment to reduce their risk of getting infected. We still need more studies to understand how the virus spreads and to find ways to stop it.

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract provides a summary of a study on the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The study conducted an electronic search in May and June 2020 using databases like WHO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The search focused on identifying possible modes of transmission and included patient data regardless of age, gender, or location. The study found several modes of transmission, including respiratory droplets, aerosols formed during medical procedures, contaminated surfaces (fomites), anal secretions, saliva, urine, tears, semen, and mother-to-child. These modes may be underestimated and contribute to the spread of the virus. The study suggests measures to reduce transmission, such as social distancing, disinfection of objects, and proper personal hygiene. The use of personal protective equipment is also important in reducing transmission among healthcare professionals. The study concludes by highlighting the need for further research to assess other potential modes of transmission.
