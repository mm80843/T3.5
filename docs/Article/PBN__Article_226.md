The role of contemporary digital tools and technologies in COVID19 crisis: An exploratory analysis

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

Emerging technologies like IoT, robots, drones, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing have been used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. These technologies help with detecting and preventing the spread of the virus, providing healthcare services remotely, tracking infected individuals, and predicting outbreaks. For example, IoT devices and wearables can monitor patients' health and track the spread of the virus. Robots and drones can deliver food and medical supplies, disinfect areas, and perform tasks that reduce human contact. AI and machine learning can analyze data to predict infection rates and help with diagnosing and treating the disease. Blockchain technology can securely store and share data, while cloud computing enables the storage and analysis of large amounts of data. These technologies are helping us during this pandemic, but there are still challenges to address, such as privacy concerns and ensuring the accuracy and safety of the data collected.
