## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the role of emerging digital technologies in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The study reviews various articles and research efforts that have utilized technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), blockchain, 5G, robots, drones, big data, cloud computing, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) to combat the pandemic. It highlights the potential benefits and impacts of these technologies in areas such as detection and diagnosis of the virus, prevention and control measures, tracking and monitoring of infected individuals, contact tracing, prediction of future cases, vaccine and drug development, assisting healthcare workers, supply chain management, and remote monitoring of patients. The abstract also acknowledges the challenges and limitations associated with the use of these technologies, such as scalability, data security and privacy, interoperability, and ethical considerations. Overall, the findings suggest that emerging technologies have played a crucial role in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and have the potential for further utilization and development in pandemic control.

## Summary of the article

Emerging technologies like IoT, robots, drones, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cloud computing have been used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. These technologies help with detecting and preventing the spread of the virus, providing healthcare services remotely, tracking infected individuals, and predicting outbreaks. For example, IoT devices and wearables can monitor patients' health and track the spread of the virus. Robots and drones can deliver food and medical supplies, disinfect areas, and perform tasks that reduce human contact. AI and machine learning can analyze data to predict infection rates and help with diagnosing and treating the disease. Blockchain technology can securely store and share data, while cloud computing enables the storage and analysis of large amounts of data. These technologies are helping us during this pandemic, but there are still challenges to address, such as privacy concerns and ensuring the accuracy and safety of the data collected.
