## Short summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in the sharing of medical discoveries through preprints, which are unvetted and unfiltered research papers. Over 19,000 articles about COVID-19 were shared in the first four months of the pandemic, with preprints making up a third of them. Preprints have played a crucial role in rapidly disseminating information and influencing public health policies. For example, early preprints provided insights into the transmissibility and pre-symptomatic transmission of the virus, leading to changes in quarantine and contact tracing policies. However, the increase in preprints also exposed the drawbacks of the scientific process, including fraudulent studies and the spread of disinformation. There have been cases where preprints were fraudulent or based on flawed data, causing harm and leading to incorrect treatment recommendations. The rapid pace of publishing during the pandemic has highlighted shortcomings in peer review and research quality, raising questions about how to improve the scientific process. While preprints have accelerated research, the responsible use of preprints and maintaining scientific rigor are crucial to ensure accurate and reliable scientific information.

## Summary of the article

The COVID-19 pandemic led to a lot of scientific research being done really quickly. One way that researchers shared their findings was through preprints, which are studies that haven't been reviewed by other scientists yet. Preprints helped scientists share information faster, but they also led to some studies that were fraudulent or not true. It's important to be careful when reading preprints and to wait for other scientists to review the research before we know if it's true or not. Preprints are here to stay, but scientists need to make sure they are sharing information responsibly.
