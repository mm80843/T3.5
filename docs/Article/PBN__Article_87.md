## Short summary of the article

This study aimed to investigate the impact of architectural and urban design on the experiences of residents in gated communities compared to non-gated communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focused on the case study of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and conducted a survey of faculty members in both gated and non-gated communities. The results showed that residents in gated communities believed that living in these communities reduced the risk of infection due to controlled visitor access, less crowding, adherence to preventative measures, and self-sufficiency in shopping and recreation facilities. The study also found that housing unit design in gated communities met architectural design requirements for online education, social distancing, natural ventilation, access to sunlight, and private outdoor spaces. The majority of respondents believed that it is better to live in a gated community during pandemics and expressed a preference for gated communities in the post-pandemic era due to increased security, safety, and self-contained facilities. The study concluded that gated communities provided a safer and more controlled housing environment during the pandemic from the perspective of residents. However, some concerns were raised about feelings of isolation in gated communities. Further research is recommended to explore the negative aspects of gated communities and to investigate the impact of gated communities on the COVID-19 infection rate using medical evidence.

## Summary of the article

The study investigated the impact of architectural and urban design on the experiences of people living in gated communities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those living in non-gated communities. Gated communities are residential areas with controlled access and shared facilities while non-gated communities are open neighborhoods. The study found that residents of gated communities believe that living in their community reduces the risk of infection because of controlled visitor access, less crowding, and adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures. They also feel that their housing units provide sufficient space for online education and social distancing, have good ventilation and access to sunlight, and include private outdoor spaces. However, some residents also mentioned feeling isolated in gated communities. Overall, the study suggests that gated communities may become more popular after the pandemic due to perceived safety and security.
