During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was important for scientists and researchers to share health data with each other to learn more about the virus and how to treat it. But there were some challenges in doing this. One challenge was that different countries have different rules about how to protect people's personal information, so it was difficult to share data across borders. Another challenge was that there are different standards and systems for collecting and encoding health data, so it was hard to make different datasets work together. Also, not everyone has the skills and knowledge to work with health data, so it was important to have experts who could help. Scientists are working on finding solutions to these challenges, like using federated data analysis, which allows them to analyze data without actually sharing it. They are also trying to create common standards for collecting and sharing data.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This viewpoint article discusses the challenges and solutions encountered when sharing health data in collaborative research projects, with a focus on participant-level clinical data from observational research studies and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). The authors highlight the potential of shared data in enhancing our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic and describe the challenges faced in terms of data sensitivity and protection. The challenges are discussed from the perspective of real-life projects implemented prior to and during the pandemic. Solutions such as federated data analysis and the adoption of common standards for data encoding and sharing are described. The article also suggests how research funding frameworks and conditions could be adapted to facilitate data sharing and offers concrete action points to enhance data sharing processes. The European COVID-19 research investment landscape is also explored, detailing the funding initiatives and projects launched by the European Commission. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing the challenges in data sharing and harmonization to enable faster and more effective responses to public health emergencies.
