Humidity, which is the amount of water vapor in the air, can affect the transmission of diseases like influenza. There are two ways to measure humidity: absolute humidity (AH) and relative humidity (RH). AH measures the amount of water vapor per volume of air, while RH compares the actual water vapor to the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold. AH is influenced by temperature, and higher temperatures allow for higher AH. Recent studies have suggested that AH, as well as temperature, can affect the survival and transmission of the influenza virus. However, some scientists believe that RH and temperature together provide a better explanation for these effects. It is also important to consider the indoor environment, as influenza transmission mostly occurs indoors. The relationship between RH and transmission is not fully understood, but RH can affect the physics and chemistry of droplets and aerosols that carry the virus. Overall, the debate between AH and RH in influenza transmission is ongoing and more research is needed.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This article discusses the relationship between humidity and influenza transmission. It argues that absolute humidity (AH) plays a more important role than relative humidity (RH) in modulating the survival, transmission, and seasonality of influenza viruses. The relationship between AH and RH depends on temperature, with higher temperatures leading to higher AH values. The article reviews and reanalyzes previous data on influenza virus survival in aerosols and droplets, transmission in animal models, and influenza incidence. The findings suggest that temperature significantly affects virus survival, with higher temperatures reducing survival. Most influenza transmission between humans likely occurs indoors within a specific temperature range where AH and RH are correlated. The article also discusses the mechanisms behind the relationship between RH and transmission via droplets and aerosols, wherein RH affects the physics and chemistry of the droplets. Overall, the analysis supports the conclusion that a combination of temperature and RH provides a more consistent explanation for influenza transmission than AH alone.
