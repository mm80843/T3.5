This research abstract summarizes a study conducted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the interrelated drivers of vector-borne diseases (VBD) in Europe. These drivers were grouped into three categories: globalization and environmental change, social and demographic change, and public health systems. The study identified eight possible threat scenarios for the emergence of infectious diseases in Europe by 2020. The ECDC developed the European Environment and Epidemiology (E3) Network as an infrastructure to monitor and analyze the environmental and climatic conditions related to infectious disease threats. The E3 Network integrates spatial data and provides support tools for decision-making, risk assessment, and public health interventions. The abstract also presents three case studies on malaria transmission in Greece, West Nile virus transmission, and dengue dispersal through air travel. The research highlights the importance of monitoring and early detection of environmental and climatic precursors to effectively respond to the emergence and spread of vector-borne diseases in Europe.

Vector-borne diseases are diseases that are spread by living organisms, like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. These diseases can be a big problem in Europe because of things like globalization, climate change, and social changes. For example, people travelling from one place to another can bring diseases with them and mosquitoes can spread those diseases to other people. Also, when the climate changes, different insects and animals can move to new places, bringing diseases with them. It's important for scientists to study these diseases and figure out how they spread, so that we can be prepared and stop them from becoming big outbreaks.
