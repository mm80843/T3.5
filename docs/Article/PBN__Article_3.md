This paper introduces a model called EXPOSED, which is designed to support risk assessment based on occupant exposure in confined spaces during pandemics. EXPOSED is a universal model that can be retrofitted onto existing microscopic crowd models, making use of their outputs to calculate occupant exposure metrics. The model is flexible and can be adapted to different types of disease transmission assumptions. It considers five different assumptions on occupant exposure, including physical contact, social distance radius, face-to-face contact, being in the same room, and being in the same building. The model calculates exposure time for each agent to a given number of occupants and provides distributions of exposure times. It also calculates cumulative exposure and global assessment of occupant exposure. EXPOSED can be used to compare different crowd management solutions and evaluate the impact of different measures on occupant exposure. It can also be used for building design and risk assessment. The model relies on the outputs of existing crowd models, which may have limitations and require calibration. However, it provides a valuable tool for decision-making during pandemics.

This paper is about a model called EXPOSED that helps us understand how people can get exposed to diseases, like COVID-19, in crowded places such as buildings. The model uses information from other models that simulate how people move in a building. It calculates how much time each person spends with other people in close contact. There are different ways the model calculates this exposure, like being in physical contact or being within a certain distance from others. The model then uses this information to estimate the risk of disease transmission in different scenarios. This model can help us make decisions about how to reduce the risk of getting sick in crowded places.
