This research paper discusses the importance of improving indoor air quality (IAQ) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper highlights the association between COVID-19 infection and air pollution, emphasizing the role of air quality in controlling the spread of the virus. It also emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to address IAQ challenges, integrating building design strategies and engineering controls. The paper explains various engineering and construction controls that can be implemented to limit indoor infection risks, including ventilation, air filtration, air disinfection, and biofiltration technologies. It discusses the benefits and limitations of these interventions and emphasizes the importance of collaboration between architects and engineers. The paper suggests the use of computer-aided design tools and simulations to optimize ventilation systems and improve IAQ. It also discusses the role of artificial intelligence and advanced sensing technologies in monitoring IAQ and optimizing building operation and management. Overall, the paper highlights the need for constructing healthier indoor environments and suggests that future architectural designs should prioritize IAQ to protect occupants from airborne diseases.
