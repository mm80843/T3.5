# __Report 13: Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This report presents a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission of COVID-19 in 11 European countries. The model assumes that changes in the reproduction number are an immediate response to interventions being implemented. The results suggest that these interventions have had a substantial impact on reducing transmission, with the reproduction number dropping to close to 1 in Italy around the time of lockdown. The estimated reproduction numbers for all countries range from 0.97 to 2.64, with an average reduction of 64% compared to pre-intervention values. The model estimates that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59,000 deaths up to March 31, with wide credible intervals. The estimates also suggest that there have been many more infections than reported, with attack rates ranging from 0.7% to 15% across countries. The authors note that there is still uncertainty in the estimates and the impact of interventions may vary between countries and over time.

## Summary of the article

In this report, scientists studied how different measures (like closing schools, banning large gatherings, and lockdowns) have affected the spread of the coronavirus in 11 European countries. They used a mathematical model to estimate the number of infections and deaths, and to calculate the reproduction number (which tells us how quickly the virus spreads). They found that these measures have helped slow down the spread of the virus and have saved many lives. However, they also found that there is still some uncertainty about whether the measures are enough to completely stop the spread. They will continue to monitor the data and update their findings as more information becomes available.
