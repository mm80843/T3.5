# __Coronavirus comes home? Energy use, home energy management, and the social-psychological factors of COVID-19__

## DOI of the article

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes a study that investigates the factors influencing residents' willingness to adopt and pay for Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study finds that electricity consumption during the pandemic has shifted, with no morning or evening peaks and increased consumption during typical working hours. Participants reported higher intentions to adopt HEMS, with about 80% willing to pay for its energy features. Social norms, attitude, and perceived usefulness were found to be important factors influencing adoption intention and willingness to pay for HEMS. Additionally, demographics such as income and household size were also predictors of adoption intention and willingness to pay. The study highlights the potential benefits of HEMS in managing energy use and improving wellbeing during the pandemic. The findings contribute to the understanding of how energy systems and consumer behavior are affected by the crisis and provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders in promoting energy transitions.

## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are using energy differently than before. Many people are using more electricity at home during the day because they are working or studying from home. This is different from before when people used more electricity in the evenings and on weekends. Some people are also using less electricity overall because they are staying home and not going out as much. Despite this, there are still concerns about climate change, with some people thinking that the pandemic has actually made the environment better because there is less pollution from cars and factories.

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are systems that help people use energy more efficiently at home. They can monitor and control how much energy is used and provide feedback to help people save energy. HEMS can also provide other benefits like improved security, better health monitoring, and access to information and entertainment. Many people are interested in adopting HEMS, but some are concerned about the costs. It is also influenced by factors like attitudes towards technology, social norms, and income.

This study looked at people's energy use and their willingness to adopt HEMS during the pandemic. It found that people who used more electricity or thought they were at a higher risk of getting COVID-19 were more likely to think that climate change has improved. It also found that people were generally interested in adopting HEMS and were willing to pay for it, especially for features like home security and telemedical services. Factors like attitudes, social norms, and income influenced people's adoption intention and willingness to pay for HEMS.
