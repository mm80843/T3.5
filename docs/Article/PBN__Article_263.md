A study found that the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be found on the floor, objects, and in the air in hospitals. This means that medical staff and other people in the hospital are at risk of getting infected. The virus can be tracked around the floor by medical staff's shoes. Objects that are frequently touched, like computer mice and doorknobs, can also have the virus on them. Masks worn by patients can also have the virus on them. The study also found that the virus can travel in the air and be found near patients. It's important for medical staff to take precautions to stay safe from the virus.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This study aimed to assess the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on object surfaces in COVID-19 wards. The results showed that the virus was widely distributed in both the ICU and the general ward (GW), posing a high infection risk to medical staff and close contacts. The virus was detected on various surfaces, including floors, computer mice, trash cans, and sickbed handrails, highlighting the importance of frequent disinfection. The study also found that medical staff shoes and patient masks were potential carriers of the virus. Air samples collected from the isolation ward and GW confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol exposure. The study identified the transmission distance of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol to be up to 4 meters. The findings underscore the need for strict protective measures in COVID-19 wards and suggest that home isolation may not be an effective control strategy. The study also highlighted the importance of environmental decontamination and provided insights into the survival and disinfection techniques of Baylisascaris procyonis roundworm eggs, a parasite commonly found in raccoons. Overall, this research provides valuable information for improving safety practices and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings.
