This research paper investigates the role of ontology-based solutions in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data. The paper evaluates existing ontology-based solutions proposed by the research community and their capabilities for analyzing and managing the spread of COVID-19. The primary contributions of this research are to investigate the role of ontology-based solutions, evaluate tool support for ontology models, and present reference architectures for COVID-19 analytics. The paper follows the methodology of Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS) to conduct the review and answers three research questions: how ontologies are used to address COVID-19 analytics challenges, what level of tool support is provided for ontology models, and what are the recurring challenges and reference architecture modules that emerge from investigated solutions. The results of the review show that ontologies are used for health monitoring, disease modeling, drug modeling, and data intelligence in COVID-19 analytics applications. Existing tools used in the studies provide limited automation, and there is a lack of rigorous evaluation of the proposed solutions. The paper concludes by suggesting future work to qualitatively analyze the proposed ontologies and evaluate their quality.

This text is about how scientists and researchers are using a special kind of software called ontology-based systems to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. These systems use special models and tools to bring together different information about COVID-19 and help analyze it. They can help keep track of real-time data, like information from tracing apps, and help make smart decisions to protect people and stop the spread of the disease. The researchers also looked at different studies and found that some of the challenges in fighting COVID-19 include using artificial intelligence and intelligent systems, monitoring and analyzing infections, and making sure all the different data from different sources can work together. They also found that there are some tools available to help with these challenges, but more research is needed to improve them. Overall, this research is important because it helps scientists find better ways to use technology to fight COVID-19.
