# __Internet of things (IoT) applications to fight against COVID-19 pandemic__

## DOI of the article

10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.041

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract discusses the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IoT is a scheme of interconnected devices and systems that can transmit data over a network without human involvement. The use of IoT in the current pandemic situation can improve the reachability and care of infected patients. IoT can capture real-time health data and manage it using a virtual management system, aiding in patient monitoring and reporting. IoT can also enable effective contact tracing, cluster identification, and compliance with quarantine measures. Global advancements such as smartphone applications have been implemented to improve awareness and response to the pandemic. The use of IoT has various benefits for pandemic response, including remote monitoring, digital data capture, and decision-making support. However, there are concerns about data security and privacy that need to be addressed. Future work should focus on data storage and management, as well as cost-effective application development. Overall, IoT has the potential to enhance healthcare systems' ability to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Summary of the article

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that connects different devices and allows them to share information with each other. It can be used in many ways, including helping us during the COVID-19 pandemic. With IoT, we can monitor and track infected patients, which helps doctors take care of them better. IoT also helps in predicting and planning for the future, so we can be prepared for what might happen. There are smartphone apps that use IoT to help us stay safe and alert us if we've been in contact with someone who has the virus. Overall, IoT is a helpful tool that can make a big difference in fighting COVID-19.
