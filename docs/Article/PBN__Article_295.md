This research abstract discusses the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IoT is a scheme of interconnected devices and systems that can transmit data over a network without human involvement. The use of IoT in the current pandemic situation can improve the reachability and care of infected patients. IoT can capture real-time health data and manage it using a virtual management system, aiding in patient monitoring and reporting. IoT can also enable effective contact tracing, cluster identification, and compliance with quarantine measures. Global advancements such as smartphone applications have been implemented to improve awareness and response to the pandemic. The use of IoT has various benefits for pandemic response, including remote monitoring, digital data capture, and decision-making support. However, there are concerns about data security and privacy that need to be addressed. Future work should focus on data storage and management, as well as cost-effective application development. Overall, IoT has the potential to enhance healthcare systems' ability to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
