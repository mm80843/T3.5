Biologists and designers are collaborating to investigate the microbiology of the built environment. The complex ecosystems of buildings, which contain microorganisms interacting with each other and their environment, are increasingly being recognized. The built environment is the primary habitat of humans and evidence is growing that the human microbiome plays a critical role in human health and well-being. Architectural design has the potential to influence the human microbiome. To better understand how design choices shape the indoor microbiome, a study was conducted in a multi-use classroom and office building. Different factors including function, form, and organization were measured and analyzed to determine their influence on the built environment microbiome. The results showed that space type and air handling unit were the strongest predictors of microbiome variation at the scale of the entire building. Furthermore, the ventilation source and spatial connectance distance influenced the microbial community structure within a space type. This research has highlighted the importance of design choices in shaping indoor microbial communities and the potential to promote a healthy indoor microbiome through architectural design.

Designers and biologists are working together to study the bacteria in buildings and how they affect human health. Buildings are like their own ecosystems, with microorganisms living together and interacting with their environment. Humans spend a lot of time indoors, so they come into contact with these microorganisms a lot. It is believed that the bacteria in buildings can impact the bacteria in our bodies, which can affect our health. However, there is still a lot we don't know about how building design influences the bacteria in our environment. More research is needed to fully understand this connection.
