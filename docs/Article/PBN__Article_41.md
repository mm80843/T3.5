## DOI of the article

10.3828/tpr.2020.37

## Short summary of the article

This research abstract summarizes the importance of green space in urban planning and design, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the negative consequences of limited access to green space, such as increased health issues and reduced mental well-being. The abstract emphasizes the need for proximity and quality considerations when designing and planning urban green spaces. It discusses the disparities in access to green space, with disadvantaged communities often having poorer-quality spaces. The abstract also presents the positive impacts of green space on physical and mental health, as well as the potential benefits of community gardens and other initiatives. It concludes by calling for greater recognition and inclusion of green space in future urban planning and design to create healthier post-pandemic environments.

## Summary of the article

During the last few decades, cities have been growing really fast and more people are living in cities than ever before. This has made life better for many people, but it has also caused some problems. People's health, both physical and mental, is getting worse because there are not enough places to play or relax in cities. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this even worse because people have to stay home and can't go out to parks and other green spaces. Having access to green spaces, like parks, is really important for our health. It can help prevent diseases and make us feel happier. But not all neighborhoods have enough green spaces. This is a problem that needs to be fixed, even after the pandemic is over. Green spaces are really important for our well-being and we need to make sure everyone has access to them.
