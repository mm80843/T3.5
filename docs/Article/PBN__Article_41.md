During the last few decades, cities have been growing really fast and more people are living in cities than ever before. This has made life better for many people, but it has also caused some problems. People's health, both physical and mental, is getting worse because there are not enough places to play or relax in cities. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this even worse because people have to stay home and can't go out to parks and other green spaces. Having access to green spaces, like parks, is really important for our health. It can help prevent diseases and make us feel happier. But not all neighborhoods have enough green spaces. This is a problem that needs to be fixed, even after the pandemic is over. Green spaces are really important for our well-being and we need to make sure everyone has access to them.
