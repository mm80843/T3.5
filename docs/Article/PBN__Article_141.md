This research paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the UK infrastructure sector and the changes that organizations within the sector have had to undertake in order to adhere to lockdown rules while remaining productive. The study adopts a qualitative research methodology, utilizing semi-structured interviews with representatives from three infrastructure sector organizations. The findings reveal that the pandemic has affected various aspects of the sector, including the management team, operations team, design team, new staff, existing workforce, supply chain, and clients. The lockdown measures have made it challenging for management teams to lead and manage projects, with restrictions on site visits and health and safety inspections. The site team and surveyors have been forced to work from home, causing delays in construction works. The design team has been able to work remotely using digital tools, but face difficulties in collaborating with the site team. New staff recruitment has also been affected, with virtual interviews and challenges in conducting inductions. The existing workforce has been protected through policy and management, communication, and health and safety measures. The supply chain has faced challenges with worker accommodation and the delivery of construction materials. Clients have focused on maintaining workforce safety and minimizing impact on the supply chain. Organizations have implemented strategies such as remote work, social distancing measures, and the use of digital technologies to adapt to the pandemic. The paper concludes with recommendations for decision-makers in the infrastructure sector, including reshaping business strategies, increasing collaboration, investing in education and training, developing crisis response leadership programs, driving cultural change, and addressing short-term challenges and regulatory issues.
