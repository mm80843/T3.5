This study investigated the effects of housing built environment characteristics on mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown. A web-based survey was administered to 8,177 undergraduate students in Italy, assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, impulsivity, sleep quality, and quality of life. The survey also gathered data on housing physical characteristics including size, outdoor space, views, and indoor quality. Results showed that students living in small apartments with poor quality views and indoor areas were more likely to have moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Additionally, worsened working performance due to working from home was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of the built environment in mental health outcomes and suggest that housing design strategies should prioritize larger living spaces and access to green areas. An interdisciplinary approach involving urban planning, public mental health, and sociology is needed to inform policies that promote population well-being, especially during times of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, people had to stay at home to stay safe from the virus. But this had a negative impact on their mental health. Many people felt sad, anxious, and had trouble sleeping. This was because they couldn't go out and do things they enjoyed, like going to school or seeing friends. The study shows that the type of house people live in also affected their mental health. People who lived in small apartments with no outdoor space and a poor view of the surroundings were more likely to have depressive symptoms. Working from home also made people feel worse. The study suggests that it's important to have good housing with enough space and a nice view to help people feel better during lockdowns.
