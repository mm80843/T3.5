## Short summary of the article

This study investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Australia and its potential use as a tool for monitoring COVID-19 infections in the community. Wastewater samples were collected from two wastewater treatment plants and a pumping station in the Southeast Queensland region. Two samples from one treatment plant tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the N_Sarbeco assay, while all other samples were negative or below quantification level. Sanger and Illumina sequencing confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A Monte Carlo simulation estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected individuals in the catchment, based on the observed viral RNA copy numbers in wastewater. Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimated number of infections was strongly correlated with the viral RNA copies in stool. The study demonstrates the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology for monitoring COVID-19 infections in the population. Further research is needed to optimize sampling techniques, concentration methods, and assay performance. Safety protocols should be followed during wastewater sampling, and ethical considerations should be addressed for community surveillance via wastewater monitoring.

## Summary of the article

Scientists in Australia have found evidence of the coronavirus in wastewater. They collected samples from sewage treatment plants and used a special test to detect the virus. They found two positive results out of the nine samples they tested. This means that they found the virus in the wastewater. They then used a computer program to estimate the number of infected people in the community. Their estimate ranged from 171 to 1,090 infected people in the area they tested. This shows that testing wastewater can be a useful way to track the spread of the virus in a community.
