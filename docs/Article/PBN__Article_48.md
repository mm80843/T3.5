This research abstract summarizes a study on wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a surveillance technique for monitoring infectious diseases. The study highlights the importance of infectious disease surveillance due to the continued risks posed by communicable diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance. The drivers of disease emergence include climate change, population increases, and global trade and travel. Current surveillance techniques suffer from limitations such as bias and cost.

WBE is proposed as a comprehensive and real-time surveillance technique that can monitor multiple diseases, including rare ones, and provide cost-effective data. WBE involves analyzing chemical and biological compounds, also known as biomarkers, in wastewater to gather information on community health and exposure. Wastewater serves as a pooled urine of a whole population, making it a valuable source of information on disease prevalence. WBE has been successful in monitoring drug consumption and lifestyle choices.

The study suggests that WBE can be expanded to monitor infectious diseases by analyzing biomarkers of pathogenic organisms, inflammation, pharmacological interventions, and antimicrobial resistance in wastewater. The presence of pathogenic DNA/RNA residues, inflammation biomarkers, pharmaceuticals, and antimicrobial resistance genes in wastewater can provide insights into disease prevalence and resistance patterns. However, challenges such as the complexity of the wastewater matrix, population size estimation, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for effective implementation.

The study concludes that WBE has the potential to complement current surveillance systems and provide population-wide surveillance data in real-time. Advancements in extraction techniques, analytical tools, and biomarker discovery are needed to overcome the challenges associated with WBE. The research abstract emphasizes the significance of effective surveillance systems for the early intervention and control of infectious disease outbreaks.

There are many diseases that can make a lot of people sick. Some of these diseases are new and have never been seen before. They can spread quickly and cause outbreaks all over the world. There are different ways that people try to keep track of these diseases and stop them from spreading. One new way is called Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE). WBE is a technique that looks at the water we use and can tell us if there are any harmful germs or chemicals in it. By studying the water, scientists can learn about the health of a whole community and if there are any diseases going around. This can help them respond faster and keep people safe. But there are still some challenges that scientists need to figure out, like how to extract the germs or chemicals from the water and how to measure the population size accurately. With more research, WBE could be a really helpful tool in fighting infectious diseases.
