This research review examines various facilities management (FM) interventions aimed at preventing the transmission of respiratory viruses in built environments. The study covers interventions in HVAC systems, drainage systems, cleaning practices, and space and occupancy management. The review finds that while HVAC interventions, such as increasing ventilation rates and using HEPA filters, can be effective in reducing airborne transmission, more research is needed to determine optimal ventilation rates and maintenance practices. Drainage system interventions, particularly in high-rise buildings, are also important in preventing virus transmission. Proper cleaning practices, including surface disinfection and waste management, are crucial for preventing fomite transmission. Additionally, the review highlights the importance of space and occupancy management, including controlling occupant density and implementing social distancing measures. Emerging technologies, such as IoT-based applications and UVGI systems, show promise in infection control but require further evaluation. Overall, this review identifies research gaps and provides a foundation for the development of integrated FM solutions for respiratory infection control in built environments.

This article is about how facilities management (FM) can help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses in buildings. FM includes things like ventilation, cleaning, and occupant management. The article looked at different studies on these topics and found that improving ventilation, using air filters, and using UV lights can help reduce the spread of viruses in buildings. It also found that maintaining building systems, like drainage systems, and practicing good cleaning and hygiene can also make a difference. The article suggests that more research is needed to understand the best ways to prevent virus transmission in buildings and how to make FM interventions more cost-effective.
