The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world and changed the way we live. Many people have had to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus. This has shown us that our homes need to be safe and comfortable for long periods of time. It has also shown us that our buildings and cities need to be more sustainable and resilient to handle future disease outbreaks. The pandemic has highlighted the need for better ways to prevent the spread of viruses in buildings, such as touchless technologies and self-cleaning spaces. It has also shown us the importance of having green spaces and access to nature in our homes. The pandemic has increased our energy and water consumption at home, so we need to find more sustainable ways to use these resources. It has also made us realize the importance of having good internet access and communication technologies for remote work and study. In the future, buildings and cities will need to be designed with pandemics in mind, to keep us safe and comfortable during such situations.

## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This research abstract discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residential buildings and the need for design changes to make them more resilient and sustainable in the face of future disease outbreaks. The research highlights the deficiencies of current buildings in terms of protecting occupants' health and safety, particularly in terms of virus transmission risks and the increased threat of domestic violence during lockdowns. It also addresses the increased consumption of resources in homes, such as energy and water, and the challenges of waste management during a pandemic. The abstract emphasizes the importance of creating a healthy and comfortable living environment, with a focus on incorporating touchless technologies, antimicrobial materials, and green spaces in building design. Furthermore, it discusses the need for proper ventilation, temperature, humidity control, and natural light to enhance indoor air quality and comfort in homes. The abstract also addresses the importance of smart technologies, improved layout designs, and the availability of private spaces in residential buildings to accommodate work-from-home practices and ensure personal comfort. Overall, the abstract calls for a paradigm shift in building design and the development of sustainable and resilient residential buildings that can effectively respond to future disease outbreaks.
