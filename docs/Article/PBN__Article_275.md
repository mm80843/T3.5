## Property: has_ArticleLLMShortSummary

This study investigates the influence of socioeconomic attributes and environmental contexts on the access and use of green areas, specifically parks, agricultural lands, and gardens, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The results indicate that socioeconomic attributes, such as household income and the number of children, significantly influence the frequency of visits to green areas. In contrast, environmental contexts, such as residential location, have a limited impact on the motivation to visit green areas. The study suggests that future policies and management strategies should focus on socioeconomic attributes to promote and enhance the use of green areas. The findings also emphasize the need to address inequities and exclusions in access to green areas for residents with low socioeconomic status. The study highlights the importance of citizen involvement in policymaking and management decisions related to green areas. Additionally, the results suggest that specific types of green areas, including parks, agricultural lands, and gardens, have different usage patterns based on socioeconomic attributes and environmental contexts. Overall, the study provides empirical evidence to guide the development of policies that promote equal and safe access to green areas during the pandemic.

Access and Use of Green Areas during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Green Infrastructure Management in the “New Normal”

## Property: has_ArticleLLMSummary

During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to green areas like parks and gardens has changed. People avoid going to public spaces and have to practice social distancing in green areas. The study found that people with higher income and those with children tend to visit green areas more often. It also found that the location where people live does affect how often they visit green areas. For example, people in urban areas visit parks more, while those in rural areas visit agricultural lands and gardens more. The study suggests that policies should focus on the socioeconomic attributes of residents to promote visits to green areas and that different types of green areas should be properly prepared and made available for use.
