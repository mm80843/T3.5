## Summary of the article

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people got sick and many people died. It was a very serious and scary time for everyone. The virus that caused COVID-19 could be spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Because of this, many workplaces had to close and people had to work from home. But now, as we are starting to reopen, we need to make sure that our offices and workplaces are safe from the virus. This means following rules and guidelines from health organizations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We also need to make changes to our buildings, like improving ventilation systems and having less close contact between people. It's important that we do everything we can to keep workers safe from the virus so that everyone can go back to work and our economies can start to recover.
