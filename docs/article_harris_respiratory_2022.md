## Abstract

COVID-19 is the most recent respiratory pandemic to
necessitate better knowledge about city planning and
design. The complex connections between cities and
pandemics, however challenge traditional approaches to
reviewing literature. In this article we adopted a rapid
review methodology. We review the historical literature on
respiratory pandemics and their documented connections to
urban planning and design (both broadly defined as being
concerned with cities as complex systems). Our systematic
search across multidisciplinary databases returned a total
of 1323 sources, with 92 articles included in the final
review. Findings showed that the literature represents the
multi-scalar nature of cities and pandemics â€“ pandemics
are global phenomena spread through an interconnected
world, but require regional, city, local and individual
responses. We characterise the literature under ten themes:
scale (global to local); built environment; governance;
modelling; non-pharmaceutical interventions; socioeconomic
factors; system preparedness; system responses; underserved
and vulnerable populations; and future-proofing urban
planning and design. We conclude that the historical
literature captures how city planning and design intersects
with a public health response to respiratory pandemics. Our
thematic framework provides parameters for future research
and policy responses to the varied connections between
cities and respiratory pandemics.
