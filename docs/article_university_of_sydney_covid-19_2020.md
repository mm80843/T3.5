* Abstract: A study conducted in Sydney, Australia, during the early
epidemic stage of COVID-19 has found an association between
lower humidity and an increase in locally acquired positive
cases. Researchers discovered a 1 percent decrease in
humidity could increase the number of COVID-19 cases by 6
percent.
