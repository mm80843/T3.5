## Abstract

Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic
has swept through many cities around the world, claiming
millions of lives and causing major socio-economic impacts.
The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture
when smart solutions and technologies have become
ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this
review, we examine how smart city solutions and
technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing
planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities.
For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have
discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and
technologies during the pandemic. The results were
synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and
preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This
review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can
enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition,
the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among
other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict
pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely
response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus,
provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply
chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and
offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are
promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart
solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be
noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful
attention to important issues and challenges related to
privacy and security, access to open-source data,
technological affordance, legal barriers, technological
feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this
review shows that further development of smart city
initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for
enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future
events.
