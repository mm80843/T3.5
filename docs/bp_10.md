## Description

### Blueprint title

Installing UV in ductwork

### Idea description

Airborne transmission is one of the main ways through which diseases spread. Typically microorganisms/viruses concentration in closed areas is controlled through natural or mechanical ventilation systems. In this sense, it has to be remarked that ventilation systems are designed for users’ comfort, so in some scenarios (such as a pandemic) the necessary room air changes per hour recommended for airborne infection control may not be reached. UV-C can effectively supplement ventilation, inactivating harmful sources of disease before air flows reach occupied rooms

### Why?

UV-C irradiation is an 80-year-old technology that has been successfully used to safely, quietly, effectively and economically reducing microorganisms spread. UV-C for germicidal spread control works primarily by causing damage to nucleic acids (DNA & RNA), universally present in pathogenic microbes, so its efficacy against current and future protozoa, fungi, bacteria and viruses is guaranteed , provided the appropriate dosage of light.

### Contextual situations

UV-C lights shall be used in unoccupied spaces (either in ductwork or within a room) to clean air flows entering occupied spaces (e.g healthcare facilities, office spaces, schools, public buildings, etc.)

### Problems to solve

As infectious diseases are frequently transmitted through the air, HVAC systems can have a major effect on their transmission from one place to another. The installation of UV-C light in ductwork allows inactivating microorganisms without severely affecting the operation of HVAC systems.

### Value proposition

UV-C light fixtures can eliminate viruses and other microorganisms, to allow air to be circulated within a building without any major changes in the existing facilities, hence providing a safe indoor environment for the users.

### Capabilities

A proper set-up of the UV-C radiation variables (intensity, wavelength and duration of the exposure) greatly modifies the performance of the system. Therefore, it can be tuned to reduce the presence of specific microorganisms as needed.
According to existing literature, it is feasible to inactivate 90-99.9% microorganisms (including SARS-CoV virus) by installing UV-C lamps.
UV-C irradiation is very flexible, depending on the strategy to fight microorganisms. Different analogous systems can be found in the market: in-duct systems, upper room decontamination systems, and mobile on-the-roll systems.

### Restrictions and limitations

UVC can degrade certain materials, especially plastics used in air-handling equipment, so some shielding solution might be needed.
In what concerns the maintenance staff, UV-C radiation can be damaging to eyes and skin.
