## Description

### Blueprint title

Installing UV in ductwork

### Idea description

Airborne transmission is one of the main routes by which diseases spread. Normally, the concentration of microorganisms/viruses in enclosed spaces is controlled by natural or mechanical ventilation systems. In this context, it should be noted that ventilation systems are designed for the comfort of the users, so in some scenarios (e.g. pandemic) the recommended air change per hour for controlling airborne infections cannot be achieved. UV-C can effectively supplement ventilation and inactivate harmful sources of disease before air flows reach occupied spaces.

### Why?

UV-C irradiation is an 80-year-old technology that has been successfully used to reduce the spread of microorganisms safely, quietly, effectively and economically. UV-C for germicidal spread control works primarily by damaging nucleic acids (DNA & RNA) that are ubiquitous in pathogenic microbes. Effectiveness against current and future protozoa, fungi, bacteria and viruses is therefore guaranteed, provided the light dose is appropriate.

### Contextual situations

UV-C lights shall be used in unoccupied spaces (either in ductwork or within a room) to clean air flows entering occupied spaces (e.g healthcare facilities, office spaces, schools, public buildings, etc.)

### Problems to solve

Since infectious diseases are often airborne, HVAC systems can have a major impact on the transmission of disease from one place to another. Installing UV-C light in ventilation ducts allows microorganisms to be inactivated without seriously affecting the operation of HVAC systems.

### Value proposition

UV-C light fixtures can eliminate viruses and other microorganisms, to allow air to be circulated within a building without any major changes in the existing facilities, hence providing a safe indoor environment for the users.

### Capabilities

The correct adjustment of the UV-C radiation variables (intensity, wavelength and duration of irradiation) significantly changes the performance of the system. Therefore, the system can be adjusted to reduce the presence of certain microorganisms as needed.
According to existing literature, it is possible to inactivate 90-99.9% of microorganisms (including the SARS-CoV virus) by installing UV-C lamps.
UV-C irradiation is very flexible and depends on the strategy for controlling microorganisms. Various analogue systems can be found on the market: In-channel systems, upper room decontamination systems and mobile systems on rollers.

### Restrictions and limitations

UVC can degrade certain materials, especially plastics used in air-handling equipment, so some shielding solution might be needed.
In what concerns the maintenance staff, UV-C radiation can be damaging to eyes and skin.
