## Is the risk affecting GBN scales

* [Yes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Scale_1.md)

## Type of impact of the risk (according to ISO37100)

* [Health and care](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Purpose_0.md)

## Type of purpose of the risk (according to ISO37100)

* [Well-being](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/ISO/PBN__ISO_Impact_1.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Develop and promote non-invasive testing methods, such as saliva or wastewater-based surveillance, to increase testing uptake.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/pages/Mitigation/PBN__Mitigation_3071.md)

## Name of the risk
