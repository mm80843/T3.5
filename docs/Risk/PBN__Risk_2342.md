* [Biodiversity and ecosystem services](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/RiskISO/PBN__RiskISO_Purpose_4.md)

## Type of purpose of the risk (according to ISO37100)

* [Responsible resource use](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/RiskISO/PBN__RiskISO_Impact_4.md)

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Conduct infectivity tests to determine whether the genetic material is present in intact virus particles or as free nucleic acids.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/RiskMitigation/PBN__RiskMitigation_3044.md)
