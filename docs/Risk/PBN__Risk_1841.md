# __Trade-offs between efficiency and stability__

## Name of the risk

Potential improvements in stability may be outweighed by significant decreases in economic activity and income levels.

## Description of the risk

Localizing GVCs may lead to stability gains but at the cost of economic efficiency and reduced GDP.

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Promote policies that strike a balance between efficiency gains and resilience to shocks in GVCs.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/RiskMitigation/PBN__RiskMitigation_2427.md)
