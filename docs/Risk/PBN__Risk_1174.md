# __Limited effectiveness of upper-room UVGI if room air is not well mixed__

## Mitigations of this risk

* [Implement strategies to promote good room air mixing, such as ceiling mounted fans, to ensure even distribution of aerosol particles in the UV field](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/RiskMitigation/PBN__RiskMitigation_1626.md)

## People affected by this risk

* [room occupants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_703.md)
* [maintenance staff](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Stakeholder/PBN__Stakeholder_704.md)

## Name of the risk

Inadequate air mixing can lead to areas in the room where larger aerosol particles are not exposed to the UV-C light, reducing the overall effectiveness of the system

## Description of the risk

The effectiveness of upper-room UVGI in disinfecting the air is dependent on good air mixing between the upper and lower portions of the room space
