# Blueprint: __Rotating groups at work, school best against COVID-19 spread: Study__ (BP_7)


## Details

* Cluster: __processing-wireless__ ([Cluster_1](cluster_1))



## Description


### Blueprint title

Access limitation

### Idea description

Therefore, the observance of certain rules of social distancing is essential to avoid any contamination and allow residents to go out. Some solutions are already conceivable such as:
-Limiting the duration of stay in the area ... well implemented in the past
-Controlling the number of people entering a given area at a given time.

### Why?

Controlling access is one of the most important points in limiting the spread of a virus. especially because 
-	By limiting access nodes/points, we have a better overview of human circulation
-	We can better monitor entry and exit points
We can achieve a safe and comfortable occupancy level

### Contextual situations

The context of the application of access restrictions is the following:
-	Rush hour : How can the danger be managed at this time? 
-	Opening hours : How can the opening time be reduced ? 
-	Choice of customers ?
-	More personalised service ? 
This contextual problem must be applied to all people entering the building 
Special attention must be paid to the access nodes of public buildings 
In the design phase, risk must also be included in the study.

### Problems to solve

The measure avoids overcrowding
It allows people staying in the building to maintain a distance that completely eliminates person-to-person transmission

### Value proposition

To limit access, several solutions can be created 
-	Control over the occupancy level
-	Control over critical parameters
-	Higher quality of service
-	Better planning
-	Diversification of customer service channels

### Capabilities

Thanks to technology and the digital twin, the possibilities for controlling access and the flow of people can be greatly improved. Various solutions are conceivable 
-	Sensors to monitor occupancy
-	Telephone service
-	Remote service as an alternative
-	Appointment scheduling system
-	Intelligent people counter
-	Contactless registration / access (badges)

### Restrictions and limitations

Restricting access is above all depriving residents of freedom of movement. The acceptance of the residents is the first obstacle.
In addition, there are some logistical issues that may be difficult to implement, such as changing opening hours or barriers to accessing services 
In addition, there may be circumstances where we cannot limit access nodes 
Emergencies can be complicated to manage: unforeseen situations that require immediate attention
The last point is the downtime when the client does not show up.

### Transmission

Direct & Indirect

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design & Operational

### Demonstrated

Access limitation was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic

### Permanent

Temporary

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A digital twin could be used to visualise how to optimise the access limitation in a building without entirely compromising the circulation with its structure

### Adverse costs

Potentially high costs related to operating the checkpoint. Increased surveillance could lead to social consequences.
