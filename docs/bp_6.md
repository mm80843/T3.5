## Description

### Blueprint title

Checkpoint allocation for access limitation

### Idea description

This aims at stablishing checkpoints at high-traffic locations or key nodes to restrict further access. Checkpoints aim to monitor relevant parameters related either to the space, such as indoor air quality or occupancy rates, or to the personal health of users (body temperature, display of test results, registration of personal presence, etc.). Based on the results, user access can be restricted or prohibited to ensure either satisfactory occupancy or user compliance with health protection measures, and users can be notified in the event of a local outbreak while they are in the building.

### Why?

The main effect would be to improve the management of inhabited places, both in terms of occupancy and maintaining a high level of health among users. In this way, the measure will reduce the risk of contagion among workers and possibly lead to greater client confidence.

### Contextual situations

This measure could be integrated into the early design phase of a new building, as well as applied in an existing building or area, if conditions permit, when there is a potential risk of epidemics. The measure should be applied in high traffic areas where key nodes lead to access to further areas, so that checkpoints can be established to potentially restrict access by users.

### Problems to solve

People who are in the building are healthy and comply with health safety measures adopted. Indoor air quality is always adequate to prevent virus transmission. Occupancy levels can be limited at a satisfying level when necessary to allow for social distances and lowering transmission risk.

### Value proposition

Restricting access based on occupancy rates and personal health measures would allow for better social distance and possibly reduce the density of infection in the building to prevent different types of virus transmission. User registration and notification in the event of a local outbreak could help prevent the spread of the virus.

### Capabilities

It would be important to analyse and identify the main points of interest for the establishment of one or more control points. In addition, the parameters to be monitored would need to be carefully selected to ensure that monitoring and subsequent measures such as access restrictions are relevant to the situation and adapted to the current nature of the transmission hazard 
- Sensors at entry and exit points
- Personnel at entry and exit points.
- Temperature sensing of the user 
- Antimicrobial particle curtains

### Restrictions and limitations

Implementation and operation of one or several checkpoints would be expensive. 
Controls related to the users (such as body temperature, registration etc.) could be time-consuming and potentially create bottlenecks. This could further lead to reduced amount of user- or customer as well as decreased user satisfaction.  
False positives 
Users non-acceptance of increased personal monitoring

### Transmission

Direct

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design

### Demonstrated

Checkpoint at the entrance of common buildings

### Permanent

Permanent or temporary, depending on need.

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A DT can be useful to visualise where the checkpoint should be located for optimised action
In operation of the checkpoints a DT could manage the occupancy levels, user information etc.
