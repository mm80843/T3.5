## Description

### Blueprint title

Checkpoint allocation for access limitation

### Idea description

Establishing checkpoints in high traffic or key node places to potentially limit further access. The checkpoints aim at monitoring relevant parameters either related to the space, such as indoor air quality or occupancy rates, or related to personal health of the users (body temperature, show of test-result, personal presence registration etc.). Based on the results user's access could be limited or prohibited to either secure satisfying occupancy levels or user compliance with health safety measures and users could be notified in the event of a local outbreak in their time of presence in the building.

### Why?

The primary effect would be a better management of populated places both in terms of occupancy levels as well as keeping high user health level.  This way, the measure will reduce the risk of workers' contagion and potentially lead to a greater customer confidence.

### Contextual situations

This measure could potentially both be incorporated in early design phase of a new building but could also be a measure applied in an existing building or area if the conditions allow for it, when a potential epidemic risk occurs.  The measure is to be applied in high occupancy areas where key nodes lead to access of further areas, allowing for establishment of checkpoints that can potentially limit access of users.

### Problems to solve

People who are in the building are healthy and comply with health safety measures adopted. Indoor air quality is always adequate to prevent virus transmission. Occupancy levels can be limited at a satisfying level when necessary to allow for social distances and lowering transmission risk.

### Value proposition

Access limitation based on occupancy levels and personal health measures would allow for better social distances and potentially reduce infection density in the building preventing several types of virus transmission.   Registration of users and notification in the event of local outbreaks, could help prevent the outbreak from spreading

### Capabilities

It would be important to analyse and identify the key spots of interest for establishing one or more checkpoint.  Furthermore, the parameters to be monitored would require a thorough selection process, to ensure the monitoring and the subsequent action such as access limitation are relevant in the specific situation and adapted to the present type of transmission threat. 
- Sensors in entry and exit points
- Staff in entry or exit points.
- Temperature scanning of user 
- Antimicrobial particle curtains

### Restrictions and limitations

Implementation and operation of one or several checkpoints would be expensive. 
Controls related to the users (such as body temperature, registration etc.) could be time-consuming and potentially create bottlenecks. This could further lead to reduced amount of user- or customer as well as decreased user satisfaction.  
False positives 
Users non-acceptance of increased personal monitoring

### Transmission

Direct

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design

### Demonstrated

Checkpoint at the entrance of common buildings

### Permanent

Permanent or temporary, depending on need.

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A DT can be useful to visualise where the checkpoint should be located for optimised action
In operation of the checkpoints a DT could manage the occupancy levels, user information etc.
