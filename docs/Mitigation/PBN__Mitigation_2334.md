## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The configuration of community service facilities needs to consider the impact of non-contact interaction activities on residents' lifestyles and needs. It requires the optimization and adjustment of facility allocation in different community life circles based on the scale effect observed. This approach promotes access to community services, ensures fairness and sharing, and improves the quality of life in urban communities.
