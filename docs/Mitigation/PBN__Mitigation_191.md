## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Graphene-based nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), can be used to develop antiviral coatings that inhibit the survival and transmission of viruses on surfaces. The coatings work by disrupting the viral membrane and preventing viral binding through electrostatic interactions and sharp edges. They can be applied to frequently touched items and surfaces in hospitals, schools, and public places.
