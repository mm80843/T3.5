## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Partitioning the rooms or corridors to create anterooms that act as buffer zones between the patient's room and corridor, providing space for health care workers to put on or take off personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfect medical devices.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
