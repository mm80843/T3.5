# __Partitioning to make anterooms__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Rapid expansion of temporary, reliable airborne-infection isolation rooms with negative air machines for critical COVID-19 patients](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_77.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Migration of infectious particles from the isolation room into the corridor](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2928.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Partitioning the rooms or corridors to create anterooms that act as buffer zones between the patient's room and corridor, providing space for health care workers to put on or take off personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfect medical devices.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies
