## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Occupant exposure is accounted for when people are in face-to-face contact within a given angle of interaction and a social distance radius. Trajectories of pedestrians, dimensions of agents, and face orientations are used to evaluate the number of agents in face-to-face contact.
