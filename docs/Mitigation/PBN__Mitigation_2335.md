## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The integration of physical and virtual space creates a new type of community spatial organization. Non-contact interaction activities, facilitated by the Internet and information technology, play a significant role in community life. This integration expands the spatial scale of communities, improves the efficiency and accessibility of services, and promotes the sustainable development of urban communities in the post-pandemic period.
