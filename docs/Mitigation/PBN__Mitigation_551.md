## Benefits linked to a risk

* [Access to relevant, reliable evidence syntheses](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Benef/PBN__Benef_537.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

KT platforms can filter the best evidence from multiple sources to provide decision-makers with reliable and accessible evidence syntheses in a timely and transparent manner.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Information overload](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_1599.md)
* [Lack of evidence synthesis and filtering](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_394.md)
