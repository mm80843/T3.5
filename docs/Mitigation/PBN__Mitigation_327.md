# __Robust linear regression__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The regression method is used to analyze the survival of viruses exposed to different doses of far-UVC light and determine the UV inactivation rate constant or susceptibility factor.

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Far-UVC light (222 nm) efficiently and safely inactivates airborne human coronaviruses](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_182.md)
