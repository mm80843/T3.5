## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Graphene-based nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), can be combined with metal nanoparticles (MNPs) to create composites with enhanced antiviral properties. The composites work by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and generating oxidative stress at the viral membrane, leading to virus inactivation. They can be used in the development of antiviral surface coatings, masks, and other protective equipment.
