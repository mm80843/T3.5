## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

By analyzing the presence or absence of viral particles in wastewater samples from different catchment areas, it is possible to estimate disease prevalence independent of knowing the average viral titer in infected stool, providing a more accurate representation of the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in the population.
