## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Opening windows allows for natural ventilation, increasing the air exchange rate and reducing the risk of stagnant air and airborne transmission.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_1418.md)
