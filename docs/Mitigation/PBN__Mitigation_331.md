## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Analyzes large quantities of data from wearables to identify physiological signals and predict infections or diseases. Can be combined with self-reported symptoms for more accurate predictions.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [artificial intelligence](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_358.md)
