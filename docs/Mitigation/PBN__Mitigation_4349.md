## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Maintaining negative pressure during cleaning reduces the discharge of dirt and dust into occupied spaces

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Discharge of dirt and dust into occupied spaces during cleaning of hvac systems and ductwork](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_3012.md)
