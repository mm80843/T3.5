## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Spatial repellents are chemicals that prevent mosquitoes or other vectors from entering a space occupied by humans. They come in various forms, such as coils, emanators, or impregnated fabric. By creating a barrier or preventing vectors from entering a space, spatial repellents can reduce human-vector encounters and potentially decrease the risk of disease transmission. This is particularly useful for combating outdoor transmission of diseases like malaria.
