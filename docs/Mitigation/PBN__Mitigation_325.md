# __TCID50 assay__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The assay measures virus infectivity by assessing cytopathic effects in host cells after exposure to different doses of far-UVC light.

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Far-UVC light (222 nm) efficiently and safely inactivates airborne human coronaviruses](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_182.md)
