# __Environmental management__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [The importance of vector control for the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_64.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Environmental management aims to modify the environment to reduce or eliminate vector breeding habitats. This can be achieved through drainage of standing water, modification of water bodies, or manipulation of the environment to remove suitable breeding sites.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [drainage](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4451.md)
* [habitat modification](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4452.md)
* [habitat manipulation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4453.md)
