# __UV-Light radiation__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

UV rays can damage the genetic material of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, rendering them unable to reproduce and spread. UV radiation can be generated artificially or obtained from natural sunlight. UV light can be used for disinfection purposes to eliminate pathogens on surfaces, air, and water.
