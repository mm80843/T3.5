## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Poor access to water leads to water storage practices that enable mosquito breeding. Improving water supplies can reduce mosquito populations and contribute to reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies
