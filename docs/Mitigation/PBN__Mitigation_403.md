## Benefits linked to a risk

* [Fever detection and screening](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Benef/PBN__Benef_399.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Infrared thermal imaging is used to measure surface temperatures without direct contact. It can be used to detect fever in individuals, which is a common symptom of COVID-19. Thermal cameras can rapidly scan large groups of people and detect temperature changes. This technology allows for non-intrusive and safe temperature screening, reducing the risk of infection transmission.
