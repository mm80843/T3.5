## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Imposing a lockdown on individuals to minimize physical interaction in order to prevent the spread of CoV-19. This measure restricts movement and interaction, preventing mass/community infection and providing better healthcare to infected individuals with limited resources. It also buys time for researchers to develop specific medicine or vaccines against COVID-19.
