## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Poor access to water leads to water storage practices that enable mosquito breeding. Improving water supplies can reduce mosquito populations and contribute to reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased mosquito breeding](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2892.md)
