## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Maximizing outdoor air supply in HVAC systems increases the dilution of indoor air contaminants and improves indoor air quality

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Insufficient outdoor air supply](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_3016.md)
