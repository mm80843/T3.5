## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Nano-spray technology involves the use of graphene-based nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), in a spray form to disinfect and inactivate viruses on personal protective equipment (PPE) and surfaces. The nanomaterials act by disrupting the viral membrane and preventing viral binding through electrostatic interactions. Nano-spray can be used by individuals to sanitize their PPE and personal belongings, reducing the risk of virus transmission.
