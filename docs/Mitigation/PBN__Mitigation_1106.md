# __Virus Transmission Simulation__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Simulate virus transmission through air-based and surface-based interactions, considering the contamination levels and diffusion rates of virus particles in the built environment

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Designing a Multi-Agent Occupant Simulation System to Support Facility Planning and Analysis for COVID-19](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_26.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [contamination values](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3656.md)
* [diffusion models](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3657.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of validation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2926.md)
