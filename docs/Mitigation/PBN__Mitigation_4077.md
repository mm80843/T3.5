## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Good quality housing and air conditioning can reduce exposure to mosquitoes and protect against arboviral infections. Insecticide-treated screens can also help reduce infection rates.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased exposure to mosquitoes](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2893.md)
