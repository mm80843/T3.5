Rethinking global trade and supply chains by diversifying sources, localizing production, and incorporating technologies such as 3D printing can reduce vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and ensure the availability of critical goods during a crisis.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [3d printing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_133.md)
* [diversification](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4373.md)
* [localization](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4374.md)
