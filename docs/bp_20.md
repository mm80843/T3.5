## Description

### Blueprint title

Mental health – Commit: Do something meaningfull

### Idea description

Act, Belong and Commit, describes the behaviours that contribute to positive mental health.  This blueprint aims at the third driver Commit: set goals and challenges, engage in activities that provide meaning and purpose in life, including taking up causes and volunteering to help others: ‘do something meaningful’. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022). 
Doing something you are proud of builds your confidence and self-esteem. It doesn't necessarily have to be a big feat. It can be anything from baking a delicious cake, fixing a toy or repairing a chair to doing well at work or learning a new language. The more we engage in a project, a cause, an interest or in a group, the greater our sense of self-worth and enjoyment of life. Doing something good for others or helping people who are having a hard time gives a sense of meaning and can contribute to both one's own and others' mental health. (Meilstrup, et al. 2022)
A GBN could facilitate the opportunities for GBN users for doing something that gives sense of meaning and purpose in life, inviting NGOs or other relevant actors to resident or act in the GBN.

### Why?

Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty. It is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health. ((WHO) 2022)

### Contextual situations

The measures could focus on encourages individuals to engage in mentally healthy behaviours whilst simultaneously partnering with organisations that provide supportive environments for good mental health and well-being. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022)

### Problems to solve

Avoiding a bad mental and physical state amongst users in GBN and lowering risks of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment as a derivative effect of a pandemic.

### Value proposition

Challenging yourself and achieving your goals, even the small ones, gives you a sense of accomplishment. A sense of efficacy and a stronger sense of self – all of these are important for mental health. Likewise, voluntary work and things you do to help others and contribute to the community have a positive effect in terms of making both yourself and others happy. It increases the sense of meaning and purpose in life. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022)

### Capabilities

The activities and measures could originate from a broad range of stakeholders in the GBN, from GBN owner, building users, local organisations etc.

### Restrictions and limitations

The measures should of course be consistent with or adapted to any current restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distancing, prohibition of gathering etc..

### Transmission

None

### Scale

### Permanent

The measures in it-selves doesn’t necessarily involve any permanent installations, but would be relevant to implement as permanent measures outside pandemics also.

### Technical or behavioural

### Adverse costs

Potential additional cost of operation depending on how the measures are implemented
