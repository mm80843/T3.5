# Blueprint: __Smart Locker System__ (BP_1)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_9__ (Cluster_9)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Smart Locker System

### Idea description

With the outbreak of COVID-19 many e-commerce companies have invested heavily into the development of touch-free package delivery networks, in particular the smart locker technologies which are eliminating any person-to-person contact while picking up the order with a specific password or a QR-code in a dedicated space which can be enhanced with further anti-transmission measures. This could be scaled up to any GBN, in particular for local delivery of goods.

### Why?

Smart lockers allow their users a far much safer pick-up of their goods in terms of epidemiological risks as contactless delivery promotes for better social distancing. Moreover, the experience becomes much more convenient as the consumer can choose from a great number of pick-up points as well as periods for pick-up. From the point of view of the businesses, smart lockers allow for more cost-effective and flexible delivery of goods due to the simpler nature of the system in comparison to the traditional modes. Moreover, a more secure transfer of goods is provided as these are tracked every step of the way through automated logs.

### Contextual situations

Due to its convenient nature, smart lockers are open 24/7 and therefore leave it to the customer when accessed if within a specific time period which depends on the traffic but is no less than 24 hours in almost all cases. As some of the other sectors understood, this solution can be also replicated to their needs. The restauration industry as well as numerous large companies and universities are adopting this measure to promote contact-free delivery of food, documents, books, etc. in areas with a rather higher occupancy level. As mentioned above, there is a need for a physical space to locate the lockers as well as continuity of activity even if the end user is not present

### Problems to solve

This solution provides for a completely contact-free delivery of goods and therefore completely minimizes the transmission of disease due to the delivery of the goods from business to customer. Further, this measure avoids overcrowding as bottlenecks from a number of people waiting in line for pick-ups are prevented. Lastly, this measure prevents the goods to be lost, stolen or to be broken.

### Value proposition

Smart Locker System is generally seen as a new way to attract new customers and/or visitors providing them with greater flexibility (in time and choice of delivery place) and more optimized delivery of their goods.

### Capabilities

To implement this measure a number of preconditions come to the fore such as the smart lockers themselves, the placement of these lockers, a mobile app helping both the businesses and their customer to track and manage the delivery of goods as well as a robust logistic plan in order to make the delivery not only cost-effective but also flexible.

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this specific measure: - Older adults’ perception of the technology as well as barriers to interaction.
- Users' non-acceptance
- Vandalism
- System crash
- Power cuts
- Need for strong hygiene measures in the area where the lockers are located
- Limited capacity if the user does not pick up the good quickly
