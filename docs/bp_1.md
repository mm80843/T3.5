## Description

### Blueprint title

Smart Locker System

### Idea description

With the outbreak of COVID -19 , many e-commerce companies have invested heavily in the development of touch-free package delivery networks, particularly smart locker technologies that eliminate any person-to-person contact when picking up the order through a special password or QR code in a dedicated room that can be enhanced with other measures to protect against transmissions. This could be extended to any GBN, especially for local delivery of goods.

### Why?

Smart lockers allow their users to collect their goods much more safely in terms of epidemiological risks, as contactless delivery promotes better social distancing. It also makes collection much more convenient, as consumers can choose from a wide range of pick-up locations and times. From a business perspective, smart lockers allow for more cost-efficient and flexible delivery of goods as the system is simpler compared to traditional methods. In addition, the transport of goods is safer as every single step can be tracked through automated protocols.

### Contextual situations

Due to their practical nature, smart lockers are open 24/7, leaving it up to the customer whether to access them within a certain period of time, which depends on traffic, but in almost all cases is no less than 24 hours. As some other industries have realised, this solution can be applied to their needs as well. The hospitality industry, as well as many large companies and universities, are using this measure to promote contactless delivery of food, documents, books, etc. in areas with somewhat higher occupancy levels. As mentioned earlier, there is a need for a physical location where the lockers can be placed and for continuity of activity even when the end user is not present.

### Problems to solve

This solution ensures a completely contact-free delivery of goods and thus completely minimises the transmission of diseases through the delivery of goods from the shop to the customer. In addition, this measure avoids overcrowding, as bottlenecks caused by a line of people waiting in line for collection are avoided. Finally, this measure prevents goods from being lost, stolen or broken.

### Value proposition

Smart Locker System is generally seen as a new way to attract new customers and/or visitors providing them with greater flexibility (in time and choice of delivery place) and more optimized delivery of their goods.

### Capabilities

A number of prerequisites are needed to implement this measure. These include the smart lockers themselves, the placement of these lockers, a mobile app to help both businesses and their customers track and manage the delivery of goods, and a robust logistics plan to make delivery not only cost-effective but also flexible.

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this specific measure: - Older adults’ perception of the technology as well as barriers to interaction.
- Users' non-acceptance
- Vandalism
- System crash
- Power cuts
- Need for strong hygiene measures in the area where the lockers are located
- Limited capacity if the user does not pick up the good quickly
