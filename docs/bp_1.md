## Description


### Blueprint title

Smart Locker System

### Idea description

With the outbreak of COVID-19, many e-commerce companies have invested heavily in the development of contactless parcel delivery networks, particularly smart locker technologies that preclude any person-to-person contact when the order is collected through a special password or QR code in a dedicated room that can be enhanced with other measures to protect against transmissions. This could be extended to any GBN, especially for local delivery of goods.

### Why?

Smart lockers allow their users to collect their goods much more safely in terms of epidemiological risks, as contactless delivery promotes better social distancing. It also makes collection much more convenient, as consumers can choose from a wide range of collection locations and times. From a business perspective, smart lockers allow for more cost-efficient and flexible delivery of goods as the system is simpler compared to traditional methods. In addition, the transport of goods is more secure as every single step can be tracked through automated protocols.

### Contextual situations

Due to their practical nature, smart lockers are open 24 hours a day, leaving it up to the customer to decide whether to access them within a certain period of time, which depends on traffic, but in almost all cases is no less than 24 hours. As some other industries have realised, this solution can also be applied to their needs. The hospitality industry, as well as many large companies and universities, are using this measure to promote contactless delivery of food, documents, books, etc. in areas with somewhat higher occupancy rates. As mentioned earlier, the lockers must be able to be placed in a physical location and continuous activity must be ensured even when the end user is not present.

### Problems to solve

This solution ensures non-contact delivery of goods, minimising the transmission of diseases through the delivery of goods from the shop to the customer. In addition, this measure prevents overcrowding by avoiding bottlenecks caused by queues during collection. Finally, this measure prevents goods from being lost, stolen or broken.

### Value proposition

The Smart Locker system is widely seen as a new way to attract new customers and/or visitors by offering them more flexibility (in terms of time and choice of delivery location) and optimised delivery of their goods.

### Capabilities

A number of prerequisites are needed to implement this measure. These include the smart lockers themselves, the placement of these lockers, a mobile app to help both businesses and their customers track and manage the delivery of goods, and a robust logistics plan to make delivery not only cost-effective but also flexible.

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of limitations and constraints have been identified for this specific measure:
- Most of today's offerings cannot automatically close the locker door. Therefore, there is minimal contact 
- Older adults' perceptions of technology and barriers to interaction.
- Non-acceptance by users
- Vandalism
- System crash
- Power outages
- Need for strict hygiene measures in the area where the lockers are located
- Limited capacity if the user does not collect the goods quickly
