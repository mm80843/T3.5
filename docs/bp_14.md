## Description

### Blueprint title

Building Adaptation during a pandemic

### Idea description

The idea of designing a building to be reversible is that it can embody multiple functions, and thus multiple designs, throughout its life cycle. With this process, buildings can be deconstructed instead of demolished, gaining time and flexibility as a building can change its structure to adapt to new circumstances. In the event of a pandemic, as we will see in 2020, this would allow the creation of a new traffic flow by ensuring social distance or improving access restrictions through the design of the building itself.

### Why?

The purpose of such a solution is to ensure the flexibility of the design through change of circumstances and constraints.

### Contextual situations

This solution can be used in all buildings in scenarios where we will need to change the function and possibly the design of the construction.

### Problems to solve

The main challenge when it comes to this solution though is its implementation. What is the process to deconstruct a building while preserving its elements ? What resources will  it required  ? How long will  it take ?

### Value proposition

The biggest advantage of this solution is its innovation. In order to change a building, in most cases we used to have to destroy the part that was to be changed. The destroyed part could then be reused to create a new element. But here, the scale of the recycled element is changed forever, so that a new building design can be tackled more quickly.

### Capabilities

An adaptative building design will allow the building design to be modified quickly in case of a new pandemic. Indeed, such epidemy as the COVID 19 showed us that the  current building design are not necessarily optimised for isolation or at least proper measures needed in these types of conditions.

### Restrictions and limitations

The limitations and restrictions of this solution also stem from its innovative aspect. Although it is a great way to build and dismantle, it is still new and not everyone is familiar with it. The challenge is for GBN's management team to be able to discover the solution and make the most of it in terms of time management, costs, waste management and human resources.

### Transmission

Direct & Indirect

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design & Dismantling

### Demonstrated

-

### Permanent

Only to used when needed

### Technical or behavioural

Technical

### Use of Digital Twin

A Digital Twin can be used to assess the new design thought for the initial building.

### Adverse costs

The measure can bring beneficial environmental effects and help reducing the financial costs when it compared to a usual demolishing and building process.
