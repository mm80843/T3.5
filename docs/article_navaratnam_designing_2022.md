## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the accessibility, social
gathering, lifestyle, and working environment to be changed
to reduce the infection. Coronavirus spreads between people
in several different ways. Small liquid particles
(aerosols, respiratory droplets) from an infected person
are transmitted through air and surfaces that are in
contact with humans. Reducing transmission through modified
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
and building design are potential solutions. A
comprehensive review of the engineering control preventive
measures to mitigate COVID-19 spread, healthy building
design, and material was carried out. The current
state-of-the-art engineering control preventive measures
presented include ultraviolet germicidal irradiation
(UVGI), bipolar ionization, vertical gardening, and indoor
plants. They have potential to improve the indoor air
quality. In addition, this article presents building design
with materials (e.g., copper alloys, anti-microbial
paintings) and smart technologies (e.g., automation, voice
control, and artificial intelligence-based facial
recognition) to mitigate the infections of communicable
diseases.
