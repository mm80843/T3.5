## Abstract

Early in 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact
countries across the world. Within weeks, people’s normal
social behavior had to be changed in order to stop the
spread of the disease. In Canada, where this study takes
place, governments and public health departments were the
primary and trusted information sources. Photographs of
retail signs were taken by the author in one neighborhood
in a major Canadian city in March and April. Along with
descriptive information, the author speculates on the
meaning conveyed by the printer-paper signs, beyond their
traditional role of supporting wayfinding. Paper’s
relative fragility may have simultaneously reflected the
uncertainty that people felt in the early days of the
pandemic, while its familiar and timeless presence may have
provided a sense of emotional security and direction.
Marking a return to “business as usual”, stores
replaced many, but not all of the informal signs with
professionally produced and branded signs suggesting that
the early “blind panic” had been replaced by a form of
“steady state”. One could say that retailers
demonstrated corporate social responsibility through their
efforts in creating and posting the signs to create
awareness of, educate, and reinforce the new and changing
social distancing behaviors.
