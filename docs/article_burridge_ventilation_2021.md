## Abstract

The year 2020 has seen the emergence of a global pandemic
as a result of the disease COVID-19. This report reviews
knowledge of the transmission of COVID-19 indoors, examines
the evidence for mitigating measures, and considers the
implications for wintertime with a focus on ventilation.
