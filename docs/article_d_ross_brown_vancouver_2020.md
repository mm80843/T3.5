## Abstract

The Vancouver Convention Health Centre (VCHC) was rapidly
set up as a part of the COVID-19 response in British
Columbia in order to create surge hospital capacity bed
space. Multiple field hospitals were set up across the
country in preparation for a possible surge and the VCHC
utilized a non-traditional health care space and overlaid
it with medical infrastructure. Maximum flexibility was
required in planning for multiple patient populations and a
novel four-box concept to plan for the requirements of the
respective possible populations was developed. Key
difficulties that needed to be overcome in planning
COVID-19 medical care delivery in a non-traditional space
included oxygen delivery, unknown future patient
populations, and staffing. A clear recommendation can also
now be made that healthcare provision should be considered
during the design and build of new recreational or
convention facilities in all communities.
