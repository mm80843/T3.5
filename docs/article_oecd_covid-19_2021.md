* Year: 2021
* Abstract: With the pandemic as a backdrop, this note provides a
selected, high-level picture of resilience in
infrastructure. Dimensions of resilience are explored
across the project life-cycle, from planning and designing,
to construction, operations, and decommissioning. This
builds an understanding of how infrastructure is
interconnected and contributes more broadly to resilient
communities, particularly in light of the impacts of
COVID-19. While not exhaustive, this note focusses on
examples and observations in recent months, and looks
forward as to how infrastructure can contribute to a
sustainable recovery, particularly regarding potential
lasting effects from the pandemic and how infrastructure
can be innovative, adaptive or regenerative.This note first
provides context by presenting high-level observations on
the impact of COVID-19 in infrastructure. Aspects of
resilience are briefly described such as physical,
operational, financial, and governance, while broader
considerations such as shifting demographics or
technological change are also explored. This is followed by
a section on how COVID-19 could impact infrastructure going
forward.
