Pandemics such as: Covid-19 virus have a major impact on
the economy of the world and the construction industry has
not been exempted. This research investigates the effects
of pandemic on construction industry in the UK, and
particularly, ways in which the UK construction industry
stakeholders such as project managers, contractors,
engineers and subcontractors have responded to these
pandemics. The research involved a 30 study participants
who comprised site engineers, project managers,
construction teams, subcontractors and contractors. The
findings reported construction companies both dealing with
residential and commercial development were major affected
by Covid-19 pandemic due to lockdown and social distancing

construction companies was maintaining a good relationship
