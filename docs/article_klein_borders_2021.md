## Abstract

This article considers how the European Union and Member
States’ responses to the COVID-19 crisis in the first
half of 2020 could inform climate action in Europe, and
particularly the resumption of actions on the EGD. It first
outlines the EU’s public health and economic responses to
COVID-19 and Europe’s role in the global response to the
pandemic. We find that, based on the challenges and
successes of all these responses, a strong argument can be
made for ‘more Europe’ – greater integration, and
stronger EU-level institutions – to lead and govern the
COVID-19 response. This has direct lessons for the
governance and scope of future climate action.
