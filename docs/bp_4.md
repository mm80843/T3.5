# Blueprint: __One-way mobility circulation__ (BP_4)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_10__ (Cluster_10)



## Description

### Blueprint title

One-way mobility circulation

### Idea description

Transmission of diseases involves a myriad of aspects, being the number of people encountering each other when walking or running one of them. In this sense, it is known that appropriate traffic enforcement measures can reduce drastically the number of encounters, and consequently the contribution of person-to-person contagion to disease spreading in a pandemic scenario. One-way pedestrian traffic is envisioned as a straightforward and powerful measure, applicable and effective either indoors or outdoors, and suitable for both the public space design phase or during daily operation. It essentially consists in assigning fixed entry and exit nodes in public places, as well as pre-defined routes between them, as a means of regulating how people circulate.

### Why?

Person-to-person contagion is one of the major disease spreading routes, therefore in a pandemic scenario a better management of highly populated public places is needed for several reasons: assuring minimum air quality indoors, guaranteeing safe and comfortable occupancy levels, and minimizing the possibility of person-to-person contact. Besides, aerodynamic studies indicate that a trail of potentially contagious droplets is left behind walking or running people, which may be potentially harmful if overcrowding happens.

### Contextual situations

One-way mobility measures should be considered at the design phase when possible, although they are suitable for existing areas as well. Key points where this measure should be applied are entry and exit point of public places and corridors. One-way pedestrian mobility should be implemented taking into account the design of strategic routes, so that the restriction of people’s (customers’) freedom of movement is guaranteed at least to some extent and the provision of public services is not severely affected.

### Problems to solve

This blueprint provides an easy-to-implement measure to organize the flows of people in public places (indoors and outdoors), promoting social distancing and avoiding overcrowding. Besides, aerodynamic studies indicate that a trail of potentially contagious droplets is left behind walking or running people, which may be potentially harmful if overcrowding happens.  Staff can be monitored and trained to guarantee the success of this measure.

### Value proposition

One-way pedestrian mobility is conceived as a measure for having a better control over how people can move around, thus controlling occupancy levels and minimizing unexpected people encounters. Besides, it can be applied in the design phase or in operation, and is cost-effective.This measure is especially suited for pandemic outbreaks, where effective measures have to be put in place immediately.  Tagging it then as a Phase 1 (/3) measure to absorb the risk

### Capabilities

DESIGN PHASE: Operators and customers mobility modelling can be a useful tool to predict the flows of people; if possible, larger corridors that enable two-way circulation are preferred. OPERATION PHASE: information about one-way paths implemented (large informative screens, marks on the ground, maps with zoning criteria) is key; smart entry and exit point (e.g doors which will only open if people move in the right direction) or badges control are efficient measures to avoid undesired flows of people in closed areas such as buildings;

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this blueprint:  A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this blueprint: 
It may be difficult to implement in small areas
Users' non-acceptance 
Problematic in forced eviction situations, for instance in case of a fire or a power cut
Customers forced to lose time due to non-optimal paths.
