## Description

### Blueprint title

One-way mobility circulation

### Idea description

The transmission of disease involves a variety of aspects, the number of people encountered while walking or running being one of them. In this sense, it is well known that appropriate traffic enforcement measures can drastically reduce the number of encounters and thus the contribution of person-to-person contagion to the spread of disease in a pandemic scenario. One-way pedestrian regulation is a straightforward and effective measure that can be applied both indoors and outdoors and is suitable for the planning phase of public spaces as well as for daily operations. It essentially consists of assigning fixed entry and exit nodes in public places and predefined routes between them as a means of regulating how people circulate.

### Why?

Person-to-person contamination is one of the main ways diseases spread. Therefore, in a pandemic scenario, better management of highly populated public places is needed for several reasons: ensuring minimum indoor air quality, ensuring safe and comfortable occupancy, and minimising the possibility of person-to-person contact. In addition, aerodynamic studies suggest that a trail of potentially infectious droplets is left behind walking or running people, which can be potentially harmful if overpopulated.

### Contextual situations

Measures to encourage one-way mobility should be considered at the design stage where possible, although they are also appropriate for existing areas. The main points where this measure should be applied are entrances and exits from public places and corridors. One-way mobility should be implemented taking into account the design of strategic routes so that people's (customers') freedom of movement is ensured, at least to some extent, and the provision of public services is not severely affected.

### Problems to solve

This blueprint offers an easy-to-implement measure to organise the flow of people in public places (indoors and outdoors), promote social distance and avoid overcrowding. In addition, aerodynamic studies indicate that people walking or running leave a trail of potentially contagious droplets that can be potentially harmful if overcrowded. Staff can be monitored and trained to ensure the success of this measure.

### Value proposition

One-way pedestrian regulation is a measure that allows you to better control how people move around, thus controlling congestion and minimising unexpected encounters. It can also be applied in the planning phase as well as in operation and is cost-effective. This measure is particularly suitable for pandemic outbreaks where immediate and effective action needs to be taken. Label it then as a phase 1 (/3) measure to absorb the risk

### Capabilities

DESIGN PHASE: Mobility models for operators and customers can be a useful tool for predicting people flows. If possible, larger corridors that allow traffic in both directions are preferred. 

OPERATION PHASE: Information on one-way paths implemented (large informative screens, markings on the ground, maps with zoning criteria) is crucial. Intelligent entrances and exits (e.g. doors that only open when people are moving in the right direction) or badge controls are efficient measures to avoid unwanted flows of people in closed areas such as buildings;

### Restrictions and limitations

A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this blueprint:  A number of restrictions and limitations were identified for this blueprint: 
It may be difficult to implement in small areas
Users' non-acceptance 
Problematic in forced eviction situations, for instance in case of a fire or a power cut
Customers forced to lose time due to non-optimal paths.
