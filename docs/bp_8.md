# Blueprint: __Public places as information points__ (BP_8)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_10__ (Cluster_10)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Public places as information points

### Idea description

The idea is to turn high-traffic points into hubs where people can view relevant information such as policies, regulations, etc. This way you can get important information out to as many people as possible in the shortest possible time. This can be important information such as new rules (curfew, lockdown, etc.), but also the delivery of basic needs, as logistics were severely affected during the last crisis.

### Why?

To ensure that important information reaches all relevant people 

Indeed, during the Covid crisis we realised how quickly information can change and how important it is to stay informed to ensure a positive impact on local disease control.

 Therefore, these information points are of great importance, firstly to pass on information from the authorities and health agencies to GBN users, but also to pass on instructions from the GBN management team to GBN users.

### Contextual situations

The measure is conceived for building users and general public

It could be physical locations such as entry and exit points, intersections, waiting areas, public transport or similar that could act as information points.

But it could also be Smartphones applications, intranet or other online information systems creating a channel to the GBN users.
Need for a physical space in the building to locate the screens...

Communication between neighbors

### Problems to solve

Find a way to make the information accessible for everyone.
Misinformation
Lack of confidence / trust
Increase the communication and therefore contact between neighbors

### Value proposition

Information reaches everyone: Information in real time thanks to the DT and smartphones. In fact, the DT is a collaborative tool and residents can use the DT to get information about the building. Therefore, it is important to integrate emergency information and especially health information such as epidemiological regulations into the building.
Moreover, viruses can spread more easily depending on the quality of the air in the building. Thanks to the DT, it will be possible to inform the occupants about the air quality in their home and ventilate the space if needed
Information via different channels.

### Capabilities

Large screens and other augmented methods
A kind of “Whatsapp” groups when the number of habitants of one building is not so important. 
Mobile app. with alert and notifications with access to the DT to check information about air quality, and key informations.

### Restrictions and limitations

People can ignore the messages. The message has to be clear about is importance. A specific graphic charter has to be created to report the information in the message
Repetitive messages
Messages not adapted to all audiences
Out of date information
Educate residents on the use of the DT to limit the good conditions for the spread of the virus

### Transmission

Direct

### Scale

GBN

### Phase

Design

### Demonstrated

During the COVID-19 outbreak, drugstores or townhalls turned into information points for their neighbourhoods

### Permanent

This measure should be used only when needed i.e in time of pandemic

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A digital twin of the neighbourhood could be interesting to visualise where to install the information points in order to get the most effective spread of information across the GBN
