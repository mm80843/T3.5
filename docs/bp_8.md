# Blueprint: __Public places as information points__ (BP_8)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_10__ (Cluster_10)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Public places as information points

### Idea description

The idea is to transform high occupancy points into nodes where people can see relevant information such as guideline, regulations etc...It allows for sharing key information to a maximum people in the shortest time possible. It could be key information like new rules (Curfew, lockdown etc.) but also delivery of basic necessities as logistics has been strongly impacted during the last crisis.

### Why?

To ensure important information reaches all relevant people. 

Indeed, we realise during the Covid crisis how quickly information can changed and how important it is to keep up in order to ensure a positive impact on the local epidemic regulation.

 That is why those information points are highly relevant to first spread information from public and health authorities to GBN users but also to spread directions from GBN management team to GBN users too.

### Contextual situations

The measure is conceived for building users and general public

It could be physical locations such as entry and exit points, intersections, waiting areas, public transport or similar that could act as information points.

But it could also be Smartphones applications, intranet or other online information systems creating a channel to the GBN users.
Need for a physical space in the building to locate the screens...

Communication between neighbors

### Problems to solve

Find a way to make the information accessible for everyone.
Misinformation
Lack of confidence / trust
Increase the communication and therefore contact between neighbors

### Value proposition

Information reaches everyone: Real time information thanks to the DT and smartphones. Indeed, the DT is a collaborative tool and habitants can use the DT to have information, about the building. So it’s important to integrate emergency information inside, and particulary health information like epidemiologic regulation rules.
Moreover, viruses can spread more easily depending on the quality of the air in the building. Thanks to the DT, it will be possible to inform the habitant on their air quality in their flat and air the room when necessary for example
Information through different channels.

### Capabilities

Large screens and other augmented methods
A kind of “Whatsapp” groups when the number of habitants of one building is not so important. 
Mobile app. with alert and notifications with access to the DT to check information about air quality, and key informations.

### Restrictions and limitations

People can ignore the messages. The message has to be clear about is importance. A specific graphic charter has to be created to report the information in the message
Repetitive messages
Messages not adapted to all audiences
Out of date information
Educate residents on the use of the DT to limit the good conditions for the spread of the virus

### Transmission

Direct

### Scale

GBN

### Phase

Design

### Demonstrated

During the COVID-19 outbreak, drugstores or townhalls turned into information points for their neighbourhoods

### Permanent

This measure should be used only when needed i.e in time of pandemic

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A digital twin of the neighbourhood could be interesting to visualise where to install the information points in order to get the most effective spread of information across the GBN

### Adverse costs
