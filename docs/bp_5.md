## Description


### Blueprint title

Antimicrobial Surfaces

### Idea description

With the pandemic COVID -19, the focus shifted to reducing the transmission of pathogens via contaminated objects and surfaces. Antimicrobial surfaces with inherent, long-lasting anti-pathogen properties at key contact points, such as busy door handles, could be one measure to reduce this risk of transmission.

### Why?

The main effect of applying antimicrobial properties to key products in buildings is to reduce the transmission of pathogens via the products concerned. If this is communicated to users, it could additionally lead to an increase in the perception of safety among users and have a positive impact on the use of infrastructure and services.

### Contextual situations

Application at contact points that are used several times a day by different people, e.g. in public toilets, entrance areas, etc.) 
The measure could be applied in the design phase of a new product, or it could possibly be applied to existing products in the building as a coating of the surface.
The measure does not affect the original functionality or design of the product, but enhances the existing product design.

### Problems to solve

Keep contact points that are frequently used free of pathogens to reduce viral transmission.

### Value proposition

This measure is a first barrier to ward off the spread of infectious diseases via surfaces and is a passive protective measure 
 
This could lead to an increase in user confidence as it reduces some of the imbalance in manual hand hygiene among users.

### Capabilities

In order to implement this measure in the most cost-effective way, it would be crucial to analyse and find the most important touch points for the application of the measure 
 
The level of development of the measure would need to be determined and established, which would impact capabilities.

### Restrictions and limitations

More complex processing of parts carried out in the design phase or on existing products in the building leads to higher costs 
Regular inspections are necessary to ensure that the coating on parts is performing its function, which will lead to higher operating costs 
Possible allergic reactions to the coating 
The measure could lead to reduced hand hygiene for some users, which could lead to increased transmission of pathogens for products without the antimicrobial surfaces
Low user confidence in the effectiveness of the measures.
