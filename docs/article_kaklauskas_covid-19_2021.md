## Abstract

This review presents an analysis of three hypotheses. The
articles provide a specific perspective on green housing
before, during, and post COVID-19. The validations of these
hypotheses were performed by analyzing the scientific
literature worldwide and by adding a statistical analysis
of appropriate articles from the Scopus database. The
purpose of this review is to overview the research written
on housing developments during the upsurge of COVID-19
along with the responses from the green building sector,
because this field appears to be rapidly emerging by the
sheer volume of research studies currently undertaken.
Foremost peer-reviewed journals covering construction,
urban studies, real estate, energy, civil engineering,
buildings, indoor air, management, economics, business,
environmental studies, and environmental sciences that were
published last year were selected for review. The review
was conducted by applying a combination of various keywords
and the criteria for paper selection, including sustainable
building, green construction, green building,
resource-efficient, a buildingâ€™s lifecycle, COVID-19,
energy, water, consumption, health effects, comfort,
occupant behaviors, policy, economy, Industry 5.0,
energy-efficient retrofitting, and profit. Two, innovative
elements in this study stand out when comparing it with the
most advanced research on green housing before, during, and
after COVID-19. The first innovation relates to the
integrated analyses of COVID-19 pandemic, housing policies
of countries and cities pertinent to COVID-19 that impact
green housing and the wellbeing of their residents as well
as the impact made by residents and a housing policy on the
dispersion of COVID-19. This research additionally
establishes that a green building analysis is markedly more
effective when the analysis comprehensively covers the life
process of a green building, the participating interest
groups that have their own goals they wish to implement,
the COVID-19 situation, and the external micro- and
macro-level environments as a singular entity.
