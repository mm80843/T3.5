# RISK: __Inefficient VOC removal by plants__ (PBN__Risk_2306)

## Property: has_RiskGBN

* [Yes](PBN__RiskGBN_1)

## Property: has_RiskName

Limited reduction of VOCs, inability to maintain indoor air quality.

## Property: has_RiskDescription

Plants alone are not efficient in removing VOCs in the built environment due to low uptake rates and inadequate understanding of removal mechanisms.
