## Abstract

Abstract The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new zoonotic agent that emerged in
December 2019, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
This infection can be spread by asymptomatic,
presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2
spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close
person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a
building. This article summarizes the environmental factors
involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy
to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building
environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites
for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If
SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for
at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly
on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol
transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is
likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact
transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated
indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases.
Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is
limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive
measures to control indoor environmental quality are
required, based on a precautionary approach, because
COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public
health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel
for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the “3 Cs,”
namely, “closed spaces with poor ventilation,”
“crowded spaces with many people,” and “close
contact.” In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation
in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing
standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in
Buildings as one of the initial political actions to
prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards
for indoor environmental quality control have not been
recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain
regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2
transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and
evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of
indoor environmental quality control, especially
ventilation.
