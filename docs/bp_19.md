## Description


### Blueprint title

Tracking and enforcing use of Personal Protective Equipment

### Idea description

The general idea described above is to use technology to monitor whether people in a building or other enclosed space are using personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks. This can be done through various methods, including video surveillance, access control systems, mobile apps and temperature controls.

The aim of these methods is to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 in the building by mandating the use of PPE and protecting the health and safety of people using the building. It is important to note that the use of technology to monitor the use of PPE should be done in a way that respects the privacy and autonomy of the people using the building. Building owners should ensure that any technology used is transparent, secure and properly managed to protect personal data and prevent abuse.

### Why?

Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks can help reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Wearing a face mask can protect both the person wearing the mask and those around them by preventing the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain viruses.

In a building or other enclosed space, it is especially important to wear a face mask to protect against the transmission of infectious diseases. Buildings often have many people in a confined space and air circulation can be poor, making it easier for respiratory droplets to spread. By mandating the use of PPE, building owners and managers can help reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission and protect the health and safety of people using the building.

### Contextual situations

CCTV uses cameras to monitor the use of PPE in common areas of the building. Access control systems require individuals to scan a face mask or other PPE before entering the building. Mobile apps allow people to scan a QR code or use a facial recognition system to confirm they are wearing a face mask before entering the building. Temperature checks use thermal imaging cameras or other temperature control devices to detect fever, which can be a symptom of COVID-19.

### Problems to solve

The problem this addresses is the possible spread of infectious diseases in buildings or other enclosed spaces where people are in close quarters and air circulation may be poor. By mandating the use of PPE, building owners and managers can help reduce the risk of transmission and protect the health and safety of people using the building.

### Value proposition

The use of technology can help minimise the risk of human error and reduce the workload of the building employee who might otherwise be responsible for manually monitoring the use of PPE. Ultimately, the benefit of using technology to address this issue is that it can help to more effectively protect the health and safety of people using the building by reducing the risk of infectious disease transmission.

This can be built upon: for example, CCTV images can be analysed to measure social distancing in different context (external/in the street, or in an enclosed space).

### Capabilities

Building owners and managers can use technology to check if inhabitants are using personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face masks. Some options include:

1. Video surveillance: Building owners can use video surveillance cameras to monitor whether people are wearing face masks in common areas of the building.
2. Access control systems: Building owners can set up access control systems that require people to scan a face mask or other PPE before entering the building.
3. Mobile app: Building owners can develop a mobile app that allows inhabitants to scan a QR code or use a face recognition system to confirm that they are wearing a face mask before entering the building.
4. Temperature screening: Building owners can use thermal cameras or other temperature screening devices to check for fever, which can be a symptom of COVID-19.

### Restrictions and limitations

Still,  PPE alone is not sufficient to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. Other measures, such as maintaining physical distance, frequent hand hygiene and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, are also important to reduce the risk of transmission.

Moreover, it is important to note that the use of technology to monitor PPE usage should be done in a way that respects the privacy and autonomy of the people using the building. Building owners should ensure that any technology used is transparent, secure, and properly managed to protect personal information and prevent abuse.
