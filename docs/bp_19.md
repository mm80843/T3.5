## Description

### Blueprint title

Mental health – Belong: Do something with someone

### Idea description

Act, Belong and Commit, describes the behaviours that contribute to positive mental health.  This blueprint aims at the second driver; Belong. This driver focuses on keeping up friendships, engage in group activities, participate in community events. So on ‘doing something with someone’. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022) (Meilstrup, et al. 2022).  
A GBN could approach this by implementing measures enhancing the possibilities for the GBN users to maintain or enhance social relationships in form of family, friends, colleagues, classmates or others. Belonging to different communities contributes to our identity and sense of self. It can be large and small groups or local, national and international networks. It can be a food club, a book club, a band, a group of colleagues, a group of friends at home from the farm, the local sports association or an online community (Meilstrup, et al. 2022) .

### Why?

Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty. It is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health. ((WHO) 2022)

### Contextual situations

An important element to include when working with the different measures is the ability for the measures or activities to adapt to changing public restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distances or prohibition of gathering. So assuring that the activities can continue in other formats during a pandemic.

The measures could focus on encourages individuals to engage in mentally healthy behaviours whilst simultaneously partnering with organisations that provide supportive environments for good mental health and well-being. (M. B. Mittelmark, et al. 2022)

### Problems to solve

Avoiding a bad mental and physical state amongst users in GBN and lowering risks of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment as a derivative effect of a pandemic.

### Value proposition

It is crucial for mental health to have the feeling that you belong and are part of a community. When we get involved in social activities, we increase the chances of meeting new people and becoming part of a community. The better social relationships a person has, the better he or she will be able to cope with the challenges that life holds. Among other things. because it can be easier to get practical and emotional support.  (Meilstrup, et al. 2022)

### Capabilities

The activities and measures could originate from a broad range of stakeholders in the GBN, from GBN owner, building users, local organisations etc.

### Restrictions and limitations

The measures shoThe measures should of course be consistent with or adapted to any current restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distancing, prohibition of gathering etc.. uld of course be consistent with or adapted to any current restrictions or guidelines on for instance social distancing, prohibition of gathering etc..
