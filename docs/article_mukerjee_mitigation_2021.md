## Abstract

The U.S. with only 4\% of the world’s population, bears
a disproportionate share of infections in the COVID-19
pandemic. To understand this puzzle, we investigate how
mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or
in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of
COVID-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create
state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S.
conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public
mitigation measures. A modified time-varying SEIRD model,
incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance
Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of
6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual
policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of
mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the
basic reproduction number to less than one, the
acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to
control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by
both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the
pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a
real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our
methodology can be applied to other countries and has the
potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as
well. With this first step in attempting to quantify the
factors that go into the “black box” of the
transmission factor β , we hope that our work will
stimulate further research in the dual role of mitigation
policies and compliance.
