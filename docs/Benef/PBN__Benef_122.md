# __Analysis of large-scale and longitudinal aspects__

## Name of the Benefit

The simulation system enables users to analyze virus transmission within the built environment from a longitudinal perspective, considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of human behaviors and their impact on transmission.

## Description of actual returns pertaining to this benefit

* [Investing in the simulation system allows for a comprehensive understanding of virus transmission patterns and risks, guiding decision-making processes to minimize transmission, improve safety, and optimize building design and operations.](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/BenefReturn/PBN__BenefReturn_121.md)
