## Abstract

Gated communities constitute an important component of the
contemporary city in many countries, and the adequacy of
such communities as a housing option has attracted the
attention of researchers and policy makers from various
backgrounds. However, it is unclear how gated communities
will be perceived and reconsidered following the COVID-19
pandemic and whether this type of community will become
more common. Thus, this study aims to investigate housing
experience of gated community residents during the pandemic
with reference to the urban context of Saudi Arabia. To
this end, the residents of a selected gated community were
surveyed using a structured questionnaire to identify the
urban and architectural design factors that have affected
their housing experience during the pandemic compared to
that of the residents of non-gated communities. It was
concluded that despite the criticism gated communities have
received, they offered a safer and more controlled housing
environment during the pandemic from the residents’ point
of view, which may create additional housing demands for
this type of residential community in the future. This
requires further investigation for ascertaining how this
may affect the housing market dynamics and strategies.
