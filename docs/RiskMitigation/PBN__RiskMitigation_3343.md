# __Good room air mixing__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Promotes air movement to ensure that larger aerosol particles are adequately irradiated and disinfection is effective. Important for the effectiveness of upper-room UVGI.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor air mixing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2479.md)
