# __Physical Contact__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Occupant exposure is accounted for when people are in direct physical contact with each other. Trajectories of pedestrians and dimensions of agents are used to identify when they overlap within a certain radius.

## Property: has_MitigationSource

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [pedestrian trajectories](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4043.md)
* [agent dimensions](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4044.md)
