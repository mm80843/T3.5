The virtualization of public services, facilitated by the Internet and information technology, enables non-contact interactions between residents and service providers. This virtualization reduces the risk of disease transmission and ensures the effective operation of community services during a pandemic. It also enhances the resilience of communities and introduces new requirements for urban community planning.
