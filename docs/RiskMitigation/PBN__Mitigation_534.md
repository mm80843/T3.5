## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Minimize exposure through changes in work procedures, decrease the total number of workers, limit face-to- face meetings and communications, establish extra shifts or alternative days, and provide ongoing education and training programs.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [changes in work procedures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3289.md)
* [decrease number of workers](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3290.md)
