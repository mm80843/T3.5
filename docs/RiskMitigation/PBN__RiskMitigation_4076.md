# __Environmental hygiene__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Solid waste provides breeding sites for mosquitoes. Improved environmental hygiene, including effective waste management, can reduce mosquito populations and contribute to reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Increased mosquito breeding](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2892.md)
* [Potential medium of transmission](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_3071.md)
