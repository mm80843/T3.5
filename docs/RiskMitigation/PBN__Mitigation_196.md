# RiskMitigation: __Self-Sanitizing Surfaces__ (PBN__Mitigation_196)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Graphene-based nanomaterials can be used to create self-sanitizing surfaces that continuously disinfect themselves by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure to light. The ROS destroy the viral membrane and prevent viral binding, thereby inhibiting the survival and transmission of viruses on the surfaces. Self-sanitizing surfaces can be applied to various items and surfaces, reducing the need for frequent disinfection and reducing the risk of virus spread.
