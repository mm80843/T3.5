## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Oxidizing and breaking down air pollutants, including viruses and bacteria, through a photocatalytic process to improve indoor air quality and reduce the risk of transmission.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [photocatalysts such as tio2](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3777.md)
