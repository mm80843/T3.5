# __Germicidal uv air disinfection__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Germicidal UV works by causing damage to nucleic acids in pathogenic microbes, reducing their ability to infect individuals. It is effective against a wide range of water-borne pathogens and has been shown to be effective in reducing mold growth.
