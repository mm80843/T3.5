## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Topical repellents are applied directly to the skin to repel mosquitoes and prevent bites. Common types of topical repellents include DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus. By using repellents, individuals can protect themselves from mosquito bites, reducing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission.
