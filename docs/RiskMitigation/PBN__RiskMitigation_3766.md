# __Increased sampling of wastewater treatment plants__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Sampling and analysis of wastewater from multiple treatment plants to monitor virus occurrence and spread in a population more efficiently than individual testing.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited testing capacity](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2681.md)
