## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Eave tubes are small plastic tubes that are inserted into the walls of a house, below the roof. The tubes have insecticide-laden electrostatic netting that lures mosquitoes to the house and kills them upon contact. Eave tubes are being tested in trials to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing mosquito populations and preventing disease transmission. They can be used in combination with other house improvements, such as eave closure and window screening, to create a more comprehensive barrier against mosquitoes.
