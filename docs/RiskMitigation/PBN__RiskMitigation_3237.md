# __Natural ventilation__

## Link between Blueprint and General ontology

* [Natural ventilation increase](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/BP/PBN__BP_Intervention_5.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Adequate natural ventilation helps dilute and remove viral particles from indoor spaces, reducing transmission risk.
