# __Insecticide-treated bed nets itns__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

ITNs are bed nets that are treated with insecticides, usually pyrethroids, to repel or kill mosquitoes that come into contact with the net. By sleeping under an ITN, individuals can protect themselves from mosquito bites while they are sleeping. This reduces the chances of mosquito-borne diseases transmission, particularly during nighttime when mosquitoes are most active.
