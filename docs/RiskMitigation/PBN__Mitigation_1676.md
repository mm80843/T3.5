# __Wastewater monitoring__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Wastewater monitoring can track the presence and prevalence of viral genetic material in a community, allowing early detection and monitoring of contagious diseases like COVID-19.

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater anticipated COVID-19 occurrence in a low prevalence area](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_96.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [wastewater treatment plants](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_1353.md)
* [dna/rna extraction methods](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4000.md)
* [real-time rt-pcr](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4001.md)
