# __Increasing ventilation rate__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Increase the amount of clean air circulation in indoor spaces to dilute and remove infectious particles, reducing the risk of infection. Increasing the ventilation rate is especially important in spaces with high occupancy density and longer exposure times.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
