# __Nano-vaccines__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Nano-vaccines utilize graphene-based nanomaterials as carriers for drug delivery and vaccine delivery systems. The nanomaterials, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), can be used to encapsulate and deliver antigens or drugs to target cells, improving the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral treatments. Nano-vaccines can prevent viral infections by stimulating the immune system and inhibiting viral replication, reducing the risk of virus transmission and the severity of infections.
