# __Analysis Visualization__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Designing a Multi-Agent Occupant Simulation System to Support Facility Planning and Analysis for COVID-19](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_26.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Lack of overview](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2925.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Utilize situated visualization of virus transmission in the 3D building model to understand the spatial relationships, and use timeline-based visualizations to analyze the temporal aspect of virus transmission and the impact of human behaviours throughout the simulation

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [3d visualization](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3654.md)
* [timeline-based visualization](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3655.md)
