* [Improved continuity of essential services](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Benef/PBN__Benef_645.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Critical infrastructure should adopt a resilience-based approach that focuses on identifying and managing vulnerabilities, anticipating and adapting to changing conditions, and ensuring rapid recovery and continuity of essential services. This shift from a preventive to a resilient approach allows for better preparedness and response to unexpected events.
