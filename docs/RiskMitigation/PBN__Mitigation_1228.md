# __Improved Ventilation__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Mechanistic insights into the effect of humidity on airborne influenza virus survival, transmission and incidence](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_54.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Increasing the exchange of indoor and outdoor air can dilute and remove infectious particles, reducing the potential for transmission.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [mechanical ventilation systems](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_1013.md)
* [open windows](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3745.md)
