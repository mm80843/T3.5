# __Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation uvgi__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

UVGI inactivates microbes, including SARS-CoV-2, by damaging their DNA, reducing the risk of transmission.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Poor air and surface disinfection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2470.md)
