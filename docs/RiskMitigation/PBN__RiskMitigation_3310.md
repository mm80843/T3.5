# __Improved ventilation rates__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Increasing ventilation rates per person in indoor environments helps dilute and remove infectious aerosols, reducing the risk of transmission.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_713.md)

## Property: has_MitigationSource

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Natural ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_270.md)
* [Hvac system modification](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_2295.md)
