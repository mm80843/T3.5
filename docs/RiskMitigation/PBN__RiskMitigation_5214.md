# __Pmmov as an internal reference__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

PMMoV, as the most abundant RNA virus in human feces, can be used as an internal reference to control for sample-to-sample variability in wastewater dilution or processing, allowing for more accurate quantification of SARS-CoV-2 titers in the samples.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
