## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Upper-room UV lights flood the upper part of a room with high-intensity UV light. UV light is known to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria causing tuberculosis. By killing the bacteria in the air, it reduces the risk of airborne transmission.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies
