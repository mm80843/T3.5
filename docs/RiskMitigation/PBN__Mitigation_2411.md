# __Viral enrichment protocol__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [SARS-CoV-2 Titers in Wastewater Are Higher than Expected from Clinically Confirmed Cases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_251.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Limited access to testing](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2366.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

This protocol enables the detection and quantification of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater by enriching the viral content and extracting the nucleic acids.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [rt-qpcr](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4479.md)
* [nucleic acid extraction](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_4480.md)
