## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Solid waste provides breeding sites for mosquitoes. Improved environmental hygiene, including effective waste management, can reduce mosquito populations and contribute to reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [sanitation infrastructure](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_704.md)
* [cleaning supplies](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_148.md)
