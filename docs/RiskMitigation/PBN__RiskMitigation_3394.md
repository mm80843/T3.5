# __Far-uvc light__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Far-UVC light has the same antimicrobial properties as conventional germicidal UV light but cannot damage living cells in the human skin or eye, making it a potential tool for preventing airborne transmission of pathogens in public settings.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
