# __Composite space service facilities planning__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The development of virtual community spaces, characterized by non-contact interaction, has created a composite space in urban communities that integrates physical and virtual elements. This model of composite space service facility planning optimizes the configuration of community service facilities based on the different impacts of non-contact interaction activities. It promotes the development of efficient, inclusive, and resilient communities in the post-pandemic period.
