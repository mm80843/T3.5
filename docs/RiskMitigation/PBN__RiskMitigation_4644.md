# __Control of indoor temperatures__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Control of indoor temperatures is important to avoid negative effects on performance, as productivity decreases by 2% per each degree over 25°C

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Decreased performance due to high temperatures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_3191.md)

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [The effect of a redesigned floor plan, occupant density and the quality of indoor climate on the cost of space, productivity and sick leave in an office building–A case study](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_223.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Hvac system](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_2412.md)
