## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Using plant-based technologies to filter air and convert CO2 into biomass and O2, potentially improving indoor air quality and reducing the risk of transmission, but with limitations that need to be further investigated and addressed.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [green walls](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_1010.md)
* [microalgae structures](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3778.md)
