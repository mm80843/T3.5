## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Risk of infection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2469.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Gated communities, characterized by lower population density, provide a less crowded environment that reduces the risk of infection transmission compared to more densely populated areas.
