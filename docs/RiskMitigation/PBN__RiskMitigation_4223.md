# __Improved ventilation in indoor spaces__

## Blueprints with this mitigation

* [Adapted architectural design](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Blueprint/PBN__Blueprint_2.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Enhancing ventilation in indoor spaces through the use of ventilation systems to increase the exchange of outdoor and indoor air, reducing the concentration of viral particles and the risk of airborne transmission

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation
