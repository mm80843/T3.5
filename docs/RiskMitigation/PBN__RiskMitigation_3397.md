# __Immunofluorescence__

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

The technique detects infected cells by labeling viral antigens in host cells and assesses the reduction in infected cells after exposure to different doses of far-UVC light.

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Far-UVC light (222 nm) efficiently and safely inactivates airborne human coronaviruses](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_182.md)

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [Anti-human coronavirus spike glycoprotein](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_2379.md)
* [Fluorescent staining protocol](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_2380.md)
