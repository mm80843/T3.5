## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [High complexity of infection](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_2922.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Incorporate dynamics of human behaviour within the building, simulating realistic occupant behaviours influenced by the building layout and context

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [behaviour transition matrix](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3651.md)
