# __Improved ventilation rates__

## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [Environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission: effect and role of indoor environmental quality in the strategy for COVID-19 infection control](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_249.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inadequate ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_713.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Increasing ventilation rates per person in indoor environments helps dilute and remove infectious aerosols, reducing the risk of transmission.

## This Mitigation is enabled by the following technologies

* [natural ventilation](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_270.md)
* [hvac system modification](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Technology/PBN__Technology_3068.md)
