## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Wolbachia is a type of bacteria that can be introduced into mosquito populations to reduce their ability to transmit pathogens. When mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia mate with wild mosquito populations, the percentage of mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia increases over time. This can help reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika. The World Mosquito Program is conducting trials and evaluations of the Wolbachia intervention in several countries worldwide.
