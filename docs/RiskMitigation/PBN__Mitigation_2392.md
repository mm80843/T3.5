Genetic manipulation of mosquitoes involves using genetic modification technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, to introduce desired traits into mosquito populations. Gene drive is a specific method of genetic modification that allows desirable traits to spread rapidly through mosquito populations, potentially reducing their ability to transmit pathogens. This approach can be used for population replacement or suppression to control mosquito populations and mitigate the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.
