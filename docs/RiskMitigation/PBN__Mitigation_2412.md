## Property: has_MitigationSource

* [SARS-CoV-2 Titers in Wastewater Are Higher than Expected from Clinically Confirmed Cases](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Article/PBN__Article_251.md)

## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation

* [Inactivation of virus](https://github.com/mm80843/T3.5/blob/main/docs/Risk/PBN__Risk_3447.md)

## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

Pasteurization at 60Â°C for 90 minutes before sample collection inactivates the virus, reducing the risk of transmission during handling and processing.
