## Risks possibly mitigated by this Mitigation


## Property: has_MitigationPrinciple

In silico screening methods are used to identify potential inhibitors against viral proteins, such as enzymes. This approach helps in the discovery and development of specific drugs or therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, targeting the virus at a molecular level.
