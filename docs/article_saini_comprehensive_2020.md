## Abstract

Abstract Indoor air pollution (IAP) is a relevant area of
concern for most developing countries as it has a direct
impact on mortality and morbidity. Around 3 billion people
throughout the world use coal and biomass (crop residues,
wood, dung, and charcoal) as the primary source of domestic
energy. Moreover, humans spend 80–90\% of their routine
time indoors, so indoor air quality (IAQ) leaves a direct
impact on overall health and work efficiency. In this
paper, the authors described the relationship between IAP
exposure and associated risks. The main idea is to discuss
the use of wireless technologies for the development of
cyber-physical systems for real-time monitoring.
Furthermore, it provides a critical review of
microcontrollers used for system designing and challenges
in the development of real-time monitoring systems. This
paper also presents some new ideas and scopes in the field
of IAQ monitoring for the researchers.
