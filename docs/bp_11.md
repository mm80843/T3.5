## Description


### Blueprint title

Installing high-efficiency air filters

### Idea description

This draft proposes the use of highly effective filters as a means of decontaminating COVID-19 aerosols in public and enclosed spaces to protect not only from the COVID-19 but also from other infectious agents.

### Why?

It is known that high-efficiency air filters reduce the presence of virus particles in the air. In this sense, there are already a number of studies confirming that they are able to remove COVID-19 particles from the air. Recent experiments have shown that highly efficient particle filters can capture extremely small particles, including the COVID-19 virus. It is also an effective way to reduce the risk from airborne pathogens.

### Contextual situations

This measure would be applied in closed and busy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings.

### Problems to solve

it has been confirmed that COVID-19 is airborne. Because high-efficiency filtres can trap small particles, this measure reduces the risk of covid spread and prevents other viruses from attaching to surfaces.

### Value proposition

In general terms, this design provides the following 
-	Reduces the risk of viruses spreading indoors
-	Improves air quality

### Capabilities

For this measure to be effective, regular maintenance must be carried out in addition to knowledge of the existing filtrating technology.

### Restrictions and limitations

The limitations of this proposal include that the filter loses efficiency due to its clogging. As a result, the air supply would decrease, leading to stagnant air. Regular maintenance would avoid this risk.

### Transmission

Airborne

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design & Construction

### Demonstrated

Addenbrooke’s Hospital (Cambridge, UK)

### Permanent

### Technical or behavioural

Technical

### Use of Digital Twin

As a part of a larger DT of the building or ventilation network

### Adverse costs

Equipping the entire HVAC system with high-efficiency philtres requires higher investment and continuous maintenance.
