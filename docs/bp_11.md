# Blueprint: __Installing high-efficiency air filters__ (BP_11)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_2__ (Cluster_2)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Installing high-efficiency air filters

### Idea description

The Covid has made us realise that the air contains a large number of pollutants, viruses and bacteria which affects human life development. Related to this, air filters play an important role in our daily lives. This blueprint proposes to use high-efficiency filters as a mean for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in public and enclosed settings with the aim of not only protecting against Covid, but also against other pathogens that cause infections.

### Why?

It is well known that air filters reduce the airborne presence of viral particles. In this sense, there are already a number of studies which confirm that they are able to remove SARS-CoV-2 particle from the air. Recent experiments have shown that high-efficiency particulate air filters can catch extremely small particles, including the Covid virus. In addition, it is a cheap and easy way to reduce risk from airborne pathogens.

### Contextual situations

This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings.

### Problems to solve

Confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne and given the viability of high-efficiency filters to capture small particles, this measure reduces the risk of Covid spreading and prevents other virus from attaching to surfaces.

### Value proposition

In general terms, this blueprint provides the following: 
-	Reduces the risk of spreading viruses in enclosed spaces
-	Improves air quality

### Capabilities

For this measure to be effective, in addition to knowledge about the existing filtering technology, regular maintenance must be carried out.

### Restrictions and limitations

Among the limitation of this proposal is that the filter loses efficiency due to its clogging. As a consequence, it would cause a drop in the delivery of air, creating stagnant air. A regular maintenance would avoid this risk.
