## Description

### Blueprint title

Installing high-efficiency air filters

### Idea description

The Covid has made us aware that the air contains a large number of pollutants, viruses and bacteria that affect the development of human life. In this context, air philtres play an important role in our daily life. This draft proposes the use of highly effective filters as a means of decontaminating SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in public and enclosed spaces to protect not only from the Covid but also from other infectious agents.

### Why?

It is known that air filters reduce the presence of virus particles in the air. In this sense, there are already a number of studies confirming that they are able to remove SARS-CoV-2 particles from the air. Recent experiments have shown that highly efficient particle filters can capture extremely small particles, including the covid virus. It is also a cheap and easy way to reduce the risk from airborne pathogens.

### Contextual situations

This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings.

### Problems to solve

Confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne and given the viability of high-efficiency filters to capture small particles, this measure reduces the risk of Covid spreading and prevents other virus from attaching to surfaces.

### Value proposition

In general terms, this blueprint provides the following: 
-	Reduces the risk of spreading viruses in enclosed spaces
-	Improves air quality

### Capabilities

For this measure to be effective, in addition to knowledge about the existing filtering technology, regular maintenance must be carried out.

### Restrictions and limitations

Among the limitation of this proposal is that the filter loses efficiency due to its clogging. As a consequence, it would cause a drop in the delivery of air, creating stagnant air. A regular maintenance would avoid this risk.
