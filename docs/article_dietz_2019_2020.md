## Abstract

With the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal,
state, county, and city governments, universities, school
districts, places of worship, prisons, health care
facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares,
homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an
opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission
through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways. Over the
last decade, substantial research into the presence,
abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of
microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common
pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. , ABSTRACT With
the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that results in coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), corporate entities, federal,
state, county, and city governments, universities, school
districts, places of worship, prisons, health care
facilities, assisted living organizations, daycares,
homeowners, and other building owners and occupants have an
opportunity to reduce the potential for transmission
through built environment (BE)-mediated pathways. Over the
last decade, substantial research into the presence,
abundance, diversity, function, and transmission of
microbes in the BE has taken place and revealed common
pathogen exchange pathways and mechanisms. In this paper,
we synthesize this microbiology of the BE research and the
known information about SARS-CoV-2 to provide actionable
and achievable guidance to BE decision makers, building
operators, and all indoor occupants attempting to minimize
infectious disease transmission through environmentally
mediated pathways. We believe this information is useful to
corporate and public administrators and individuals
responsible for building operations and environmental
services in their decision-making process about the degree
and duration of social-distancing measures during viral
epidemics and pandemics.
