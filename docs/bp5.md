## Details of the blueprint

### Blueprint title

Antimicrobial Surfaces

### Idea description

With the COVID-19 pandemic, came an increased focus on reducing the transmission of pathogen via contaminated objects and surfaces. Antimicrobial surfaces with inherent, long-lasting anti-pathogen properties on key contact points, such as high-traffic doorhandles, could be a measure to reduce this risk of transmission.

### Why?

The primary effect of applying antimicrobial properties to key products in buildings, will be reducing transmission of pathogen via the affected products. If conveyed to users, this could additionally lead to an increase in safety perception amongst users and have a positive impact on the use of infrastructure and services.

### Contextual situations

Application to contact points, that is used many times a day by different people, i.e. in public bathrooms, entry points etc.). 
The measure could be applied in the design phase of a new product, or it could potentially be applied to existing products in the building as a coating of the surface.
The measure does not affect the original functionality or design of the product, but add more value to the existing product design.

### Problems to solve

Keeping contact points with a high rate of use clean of pathogen to reduce the transmission of virus.

### Value proposition

This measure provides a first barrier of defence against the spreading of infectious diseases via surfaces and is a passive measure of protection. 
 
This could lead to an increase in user confidence since it reduces some of the imbalance in manual hand-hygiene amongst the users.

### Capabilities

To implement this measure most cost-effective it would be crucial to analyse and find the key contact points for applying the measure. 
 
The development stage of the measure would have to be determined and specified, which impacts capabilities.

### Restrictions and limitations

A more complex processing of parts, within design phase or implemented to existing products in the building, will lead to a higher cost. 
Periodic inspections are necessary to ensure that the coating of the parts fulfil its function, which will lead to a higher cost of operation. 
Potential allergic reactions to the coating 
The measure could lead to impaired hand hygiene amongst some users, which could lead to an increase in pathogen transmission in products without the antimicrobiodial surfaces
Low trust in the effect of the measures amongst users.
