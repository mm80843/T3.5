## Abstract

Sustainable design methods aim to obtain architectural
solutions that assure the coexistence and welfare of human
beings, inorganic structures, and living things that
constitute ecosystems. The novel coronavirus emergence,
inadequate vaccines against the present severe acute
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-(SARS-CoV-2), and
increases in microbial resistance have made it essential to
review the preventative approaches used during
pre-antibiotic periods. Apart from low carbon emissions and
energy, sustainable architecture for facilities, building
designs, and digital modeling should incorporate design
approaches to confront the impacts of communicable
infections. This review aims to determine how architectural
design can protect people and employees from harm; it
models viewpoints to highlight the architects’ roles in
combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and designing
guidelines as a biomedical system for policymakers. The
goals include exploring the hospital architecture evolution
and the connection between architectural space and
communicable infections and recommending design and digital
modeling strategies to improve infection prevention and
controls. Based on a wide-ranging literature review, it was
found that design methods have often played important roles
in the prevention and control of infectious diseases and
could be a solution for combating the wide spread of the
novel coronavirus or coronavirus variants or delta.
