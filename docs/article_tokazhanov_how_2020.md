## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic is bringing about changes, and
alongside these, we can alter the way we design our living
spaces. The need for a healthy and comfortable living space
is essential to mental and physical well-being. The present
study covers the most up-to-date documents, including
peer-reviewed papers, blog posts, news, journal articles,
and expert opinions, to critically review lessons learned
from the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluates the expected
changes in sustainability requirements of residential
buildings. Health and safety, environment, and comfort are
the three main aspects of residential buildings that have
been tested during quarantines and are also expected to
experience major transformations toward sustainability.
Residential houses should provide certain health and safety
protective measures to their occupants, such as the
application of new touchless technologies, having proper
sanitation to diminish the probability of getting infected,
and developing greener and more intimate spaces that can
help recover and improve mental states. Our findings
address the need to reconsider sustainability requirements
for residential buildings, which will provide adequate
health and safety and comfort with no significant harm to
the environment.
