## Abstract

The COVID-19 mitigation measures require a fundamental
shift in human behavior. The present study assesses what
factors influence Americans to comply with the stay at home
and social distancing measures. It analyzes data from an
online survey, conducted on April 3, 2020, of 570
participants from 35 states that have adopted such
measures. The results show that while perceptual deterrence
was not associated with compliance, people actually comply
less when they fear the authorities. Further, two broad
processes promote compliance. First, compliance depended on
people’s capacity to obey the rules, opportunity to break
the rules, and self-control. As such, compliance results
from their own personal abilities and the context in which
they live. Second, compliance depended on people’s
intrinsic motivations, including substantive moral support
and social norms. This paper discusses the implications of
these findings for ensuring compliance to effectively
mitigate the virus.
