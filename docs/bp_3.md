## Description

### Blueprint title

Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) monitoring system

### Idea description

The year 2020 will remain in the memory of all mankind as the year of the COVID-19. The pandemic has changed the world economy, the way people work and the design of buildings. As a consequence, indoor environmental quality monitoring systems have become important for several reasons: (1) to ensure that temperature and humidity conditions are adequate (in order to guarantee the comfort and productivity of the occupants); (2) to introduce actions to reduce energy consumption; and (3) to guarantee the quality of the air. In this scenario, the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in this type of systems makes it possible to collect data and control IEQ remotely. With this approach, this blueprint proposes an IoT architecture aimed at monitoring indoor environmental quality inside high occupancy buildings, with the focus on preventing the spread of the virus.

### Why?

According to several researches, there is a significant relationship between air quality and spread of COVID-19 in closes areas. That is why CO2 and occupancy measurements are so important.  To monitor these measurements would help to decide where and when to take actions in an intelligence and efficient manner, for example, by means of automatic ventilation systems. In addition, thermal comfort, visual comfort and acoustic comfort would be always maintained.

### Contextual situations

This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings. The relative infection risk would be given by CO2 level.

### Problems to solve

The continuous monitoring of parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2â€¦ allows to guarantee the quality of the air while maintaining the environmental quality within an acceptable range. This eliminates the problem of energy waste due to overconsumption, which is typical in offices and public buildings.

### Value proposition

The proposed IEQ monitoring system allows us to detect uncomfortable situations and prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by means of different environmental magnitudes monitoring. Moreover, it leads the way for implementing smart control actions such as purifying the air when necessary.

### Capabilities

The proposed architecture is based on several low-cost sensors to acquire data and a single board computer as coordinator, and various communication technologies. The measured magnitudes allow detecting uncomfortable and potential risk situations and implementing corrective actions. In addition, the system can use historical data to decide when take certain actions.

### Restrictions and limitations

One possible limitation of the system may be the limitations of the HVAC system itself. As a consequence, indoor air quality may not be adequate despite the actions of the system.
