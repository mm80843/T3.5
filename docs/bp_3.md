## Description

### Blueprint title

Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) monitoring system

### Idea description

The year 2020 will be remembered by all humanity as the year of COVID -19. The pandemic has changed the global economy, the way people work and the design of buildings. As a result, indoor environmental quality monitoring systems have become important for several reasons: (1) to ensure that temperature and humidity conditions are appropriate (to ensure occupant comfort and productivity), (2) to initiate measures to reduce energy consumption, and (3) to ensure air quality. In this scenario, the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in this type of system enables the collection of data and the control of air quality remotely. With this approach, this design proposes an IoT architecture that aims to monitor indoor air quality in buildings with high occupancy to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Why?

According to several studies, there is a significant correlation between air quality and the spread of COVID -19 indoors. This is why CO2 and occupancy measurements are so important. Monitoring these measurements would help decide where and when to take action in an intelligent and efficient way, for example through automatic ventilation systems. In addition, thermal, visual and acoustic comfort would always be maintained.

### Contextual situations

This measure would be applied in confined and high occupancy areas such as offices (during working hours) or certain public buildings. The relative infection risk would be given by CO2 level.

### Problems to solve

The continuous monitoring of parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, CO2â€¦ allows to guarantee the quality of the air while maintaining the environmental quality within an acceptable range. This eliminates the problem of energy waste due to overconsumption, which is typical in offices and public buildings.

### Value proposition

The proposed IEQ monitoring system allows us to detect uncomfortable situations and prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by means of different environmental magnitudes monitoring. Moreover, it leads the way for implementing smart control actions such as purifying the air when necessary.

### Capabilities

The proposed architecture is based on several low-cost sensors for data acquisition and a single-board computer as coordinator, as well as on various communication technologies. The measured variables make it possible to identify unpleasant and potential risk situations and to take corrective measures. In addition, the system can use historical data to decide when to take certain actions.

### Restrictions and limitations

One possible limitation of the system may be the limitations of the HVAC system itself. As a consequence, indoor air quality may not be adequate despite the actions of the system.
