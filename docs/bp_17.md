## Description


### Blueprint title

Reducing contact points

### Idea description

This blueprints aims to reduce the number of physical contact points in the building where diseases have been shown to survive and spread, such as surfaces, railings, furnishings, doorknobs etc. This allows building occupants to avoid touching as many of the same surfaces and physical points as possible, which reduces the risk of contamination. This can be done through a whole range of measures, such as 
- Installing hand- or foot-operated door openers on common doors or lifts 
- Updating/retrofitting commonly used equipment such as coffee machines, vending machines, taps to a touch-free version
- Encouraging users to avoid touching surfaces 
- Installing motion-sensing lighting to reduce touching of light switches
- Using touch-free vending machines, lift interfaces, door knobs and badge machines, ...

### Why?

Contact points in the building such as handrails, door handles, knobs, etc. Are a source of disease transmission among the users of the building.
If you reduce the number of contact points, especially high traffic contact points, you reduce the risk of disease transmission.

### Contextual situations

The aim is to reduce possible cross-contamination points in the building by applying non-contact measures and solutions, especially at highly frequented contact points in the building.
These can be, for example, door handles to toilets or door handles at central locations with high activity or widely used devices at key points, but also contactless vending machines.

### Problems to solve

It has been proven that diseases spread among household residents through transmission via physical contact points and surfaces.

### Value proposition

Many of the measures to reduce contact points are low-tech and low-cost measures that can be implemented in existing buildings as well as in new buildings.

### Capabilities

As these measures are already widely used in different contexts, there are a variety of products on the market to meet the needs, as well as a growing catalogue of solutions.

### Restrictions and limitations

Existing systems may require certain physical contacts (as with fingerprint solutions).
In addition, stakeholders who physically work in the building cannot exclude physical contact from their daily activities.

### Transmission

Indirect

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Operational

### Demonstrated

A wide range of contact free measures are today available an widely applicated, but often with a different focus than pandemic adaptation. Sensor control of lighting and doors is for example frequently applied in buildings.

### Permanent

Permanent

### Technical or behavioural

Technical

### Use of Digital Twin

No obvious direct application of a DT is immediate apparent for the current measure. But the data from sensors etc. could be applied indirectly to accommodate data needed for other purposes (ie. Sensors data of doors could be related to occupancy)

### Adverse costs

Sensor control of non-energy consuming functions such as door openings, would though lead to a minor increase in energy consumption. On the other hand, sensor control of lighting for example based on the presence of staff would lead to a decrease in energy consumption. 
Specific contactless technologies (video, face recognition, …) could be an increased perceived risk in privacy / perception of monitoring of individuals and impede on feeling of freedom.
