## Abstract

With the advance of 5G technologies by both academia and
industry, 5G adoption is gaining widespread acceptance in
numerous cities, prompting further innovations in Smart
City technologies riding on the wave of the Internet of
Things (IoT). However, even in its infancy stage, the speed
of technological advancement is already highlighting the
limitations of 5G, and its potentially short lifespan as
new technologies are rendered obsolete faster. This
fast-moving field is coupled with an ongoing and increasing
funding into Research \& Development (R\&D) efforts by
private corporations, to potentially commercialise on the
surge in demand for ‘smarter’ cities’, This paper
aims to chart the major directions and scope emerging
dimensions inherent to 6G technology, including Digital
Twins and Immersive Realities (XR) that, when applied to
cities that are currently being equipped with digital
infrastructural backbones, may have direct socio-economic
impacts upon our lives while responding to the tenets of
the Sustainable Development Goal 11. Looking at the future
6G technology this article considers the prospects of 6G,
and its associated concepts, and its relations as they
pertain to Future, Smart, Digital and Sustainable Cities.
