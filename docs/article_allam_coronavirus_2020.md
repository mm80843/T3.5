## Abstract

As the Coronavirus (COVID-19) expands its impact from
China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and
other countries, increased national and international
measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. The
placing of entire cities in ‘lockdown’ directly affects
urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from
social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised
as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading
towards a global health emergency, and as global
collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However,
while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of
health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand,
specifically relating to urban health and safe city
concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as
solely benefiting a nation’s economy and its economic and
political influence. This perspective paper, written one
month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the
virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how
smart city networks should work towards enhancing
standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the
event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global
understanding and management of the same.
