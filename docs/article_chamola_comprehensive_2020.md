## Abstract

The unprecedented outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus,
termed as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO),
has placed numerous governments around the world in a
precarious position. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak,
earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now
become a matter of grave concern for virtually every
country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure
the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of
overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of
these countries into a state of partial or complete
lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus
cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout
the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed
cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous
false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in
regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly
since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such
acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a
detailed review of all the major aspects associated with
the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health
implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this
study highlights its impact on the global economy. In
drawing things to a close, we explore the use of
technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence
(AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 outbreak.
