## Abstract

The COVID-19 outbreak originated at the end of 2019 from
Wuhan [1, 2], a city in Hubei province in central China.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there
were 88,948 confirmed cases and 3,043 deaths from 65
countries as of March 2, 2020. In China, the outbreak has
effectively confined over 1 billion people to their
apartments and homes since the end of January 2020 and
continues to disrupt healthcare, wellbeing, and the
economy. As the situation in China appears to be
stabilizing, sharp increases in confirmed cases are being
reported in South Korea, Italy, Japan, and Iran.
