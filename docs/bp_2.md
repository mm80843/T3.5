## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_10__ (Cluster_10)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Architecture design

### Idea description

COVID-19 has shown that there is an imminent need for reconsideration of the architectural design streams resulting in the selection of the right designs that will be able to reduce contamination risks between the users of the space to a minimum. A switch from open-space concepts in confined areas is already manifested by numerous short-term solutions of space re-designing to comply with the diminution of epidemiological risks.

### Why?

More and more architects are tasked with embedding mitigation measures from the onset of the project so that the users of the physical space can adhere to these measures effectively, especially in terms of social distancing. Moreover, avoidance of ad-hoc additional measures would be much more plausible in cases where the architecture design is done the right way and the measures become an integral part of the building from the beginning

### Contextual situations

This measure is most relevant at the complete beginning of the design-stage of new or upgraded buildings and spaces. There is a consensus that there will a drive for more spacious and less dense spaces with smaller capacities.

### Problems to solve

The main issue that will be solved by this measure is the fact that previous architecture designs did not provision for contamination minimization, especially in terms of social distancing, hygienic properties or promotion of natural sunlight.

### Value proposition

Embedding resilient thinking into the architectural design will result in the mitigation of extra costs that might be endured during a pandemic crisis. Further, as there is a push toward more resilient infrastructure, incorporating this measure at the start of the project will most surely mean compliance with future norms that are on the horizon.

### Capabilities

To implement this measure most effectively a good understanding of the right way of architecture design and related Systems thinking interrelations is crucial. Lessons learned from previous pandemics have been before translated into a number of aspects in the Modernist approach to architecture. Many of these ideas can be revisited in the current times too.

### Restrictions and limitations

The main obstacle is that it is very difficult to apply these features to the existing designs and/or buildings. Another limitation might be the current state of technology such as ventilation systems, automatic doors and other contact-free features that came under deeper investigation only in recent years.
