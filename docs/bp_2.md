# Blueprint: __Architecture design__ (BP_2)


## Details

* Cluster: __Cluster_1__ (Cluster_1)



## Description

### Blueprint title

Architecture design

### Idea description

COVID -19 has shown that there is an urgent need to rethink architectural design flows and choose the right designs that can minimise the risk of contamination between users of the space. The move away from open-space concepts in enclosed spaces is already evident in many short-term solutions for redesigning spaces to take into account the reduction of epidemiological risks.

### Why?

More and more architects are tasked with incorporating mitigation measures from the very beginning of the project so that the users of the physical space can actually comply with these measures, especially in terms of social distancing. Moreover, avoiding additional ad hoc measures would be much more plausible if the architectural design is done right and the measures become an integral part of the building from the beginning

### Contextual situations

This measure is especially important at the beginning of the planning phase of new or modernised buildings and spaces. There is a consensus that there will be a drive towards more spacious and less dense spaces with smaller capacities.

### Problems to solve

The main problem solved by this measure is the fact that previous architectural designs have not taken precautions to minimise contamination, especially with regard to social distancing, hygienic properties or the promotion of natural sunlight.

### Value proposition

Embedding resilient thinking into the architectural design will result in the mitigation of extra costs that might be endured during a pandemic crisis. Further, as there is a push toward more resilient infrastructure, incorporating this measure at the start of the project will most surely mean compliance with future norms that are on the horizon.

### Capabilities

In order to implement this measure most effectively, a good understanding of the right way to design architecture and the related context of systems thinking is crucial. Lessons learned from previous pandemics have already been incorporated into the modernist approach to architecture in a number of ways. Many of these ideas can also be revisited in the present day.

### Restrictions and limitations

The main obstacle is that it is very difficult to apply these features to the existing designs and/or buildings. Another limitation might be the current state of technology such as ventilation systems, automatic doors and other contact-free features that came under deeper investigation only in recent years.
