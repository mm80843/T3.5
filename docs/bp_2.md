## Description


### Blueprint title

Architecture design

### Idea description

COVID-19 has shown that there is an urgent need to rethink architectural design processes and choose the right designs that can minimise the risk of contamination between users of the space. The move away from open-space concepts in enclosed spaces is already evident in many short-term solutions for redesigning spaces to take into account the reduction of epidemiological risks.

### Why?

More and more architects are tasked with planning in mitigation measures at the outset of the project so that the users of the physical space can actually comply with these measures, especially in terms of social distancing. Moreover, it would be much more plausible to avoid additional ad hoc measures if the architectural design is carried out properly and the measures become an integral part of the building from the very beginning

### Contextual situations

This measure is especially important at the beginning of the planning phase of new or modernised buildings and spaces. There is a consensus that the trend is towards larger and less dense spaces with lower capacity and better ventilation.

### Problems to solve

The main problem solved by this measure is the fact that previous architectural designs did not take precautions to minimise contamination, especially with regard to social distancing, hygienic properties or the promotion of natural sunlight.

### Value proposition

Embedding a resilient concept into architectural design will have the effect of reducing the additional costs that could be incurred in the event of a pandemic crisis. And as the trend is towards more resilient infrastructure, incorporating this measure at the beginning of the project will certainly lead to future standards being met on the horizon.

### Capabilities

To implement this measure as effectively as possible, a good understanding of the right way to design architecture and the related context of systems thinking is crucial. Lessons learned from previous pandemics have already been incorporated into the modernist approach to architecture in various ways. Many of these ideas can also be taken up again in the present day.

### Restrictions and limitations

The main obstacle is that it is very difficult to apply these features to existing designs and/or buildings. Another limitation could be the current state of the art, e.g. ventilation systems, automatic doors and other non-contact features that have only been studied in more detail in recent years.
