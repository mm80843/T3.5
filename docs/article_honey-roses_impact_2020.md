## Abstract

Restrictions on the use of public space and social
distancing have been key policy measures to reduce the
transmission of SAR-CoV-2 and protect public health. At the
time of writing, one half of the worldâ€™s population has
been asked to stay home and avoid many public places. What
will be the long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
public space once the restrictions have been lifted? The
depth and extent of transformation is unclear, especially
as it relates to the future design, use and perceptions of
public space. This article aims to highlight emerging
questions at the interface of COVID-19 and city design. It
is possible that the COVID-19 crisis may fundamentally
change our relationship with public space. In the ensuing
months and years, it will be critical to study and measure
these changes in order to inform urban planning and design
in a post-COVID-19 world.
