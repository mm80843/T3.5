## Description


### Blueprint title

Building Adaptation during a pandemic

### Idea description

The idea of designing a building to be adaptable is that it can embody multiple functions, and thus multiple designs, throughout its life cycle. With this process, buildings can be deconstructed instead of demolished, gaining time and flexibility as a building can change its structure to adapt to new circumstances. In the event of a pandemic, as we saw in 2020, this would allow the creation of a new traffic flow by ensuring social distance or improving access restrictions through the design of the building itself.

### Why?

The purpose of such a solution is to ensure the flexibility of the design as circumstances and constraints change.

### Contextual situations

This solution can be used in all buildings in scenarios where we need to change the function and possibly the design of the structure.

### Problems to solve

The biggest challenge with this solution is its implementation. How is a building deconstructed while its elements are preserved? What resources will be needed for this? How long will it take?

### Value proposition

The biggest advantage of this solution is its innovation. In order to change a building, in most cases we used to have to destroy the part that was to be changed. The destroyed part could then be reused to create a new element. But here, the scale of the recycled element is changed forever, so that a new building design can be tackled more quickly.

### Capabilities

Adaptable building design allows for rapid change in building design in the event of a new circumstance. Indeed, epidemics such as COVID-19 have shown us that current building designs are not necessarily optimised for  measures required under such conditions.

### Restrictions and limitations

The limitations and restrictions of this solution also stem from its innovative aspect. Although it is a great way to build and dismantle, it is still new and not everyone is familiar with it. The challenge is for GBN's management team to be able to discover the solution and make the most of it in terms of time management, costs, waste management and human resources.

### Permanent

Only to used when needed

### Technical or behavioural

Technical

### Use of Digital Twin

A DT can be used to evaluate the new design idea for the original building.

### Adverse costs

The measure can have a positive impact on the environment and help reduce financial costs compared to a traditional demolition and construction process.
