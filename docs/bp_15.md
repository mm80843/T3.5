## Description

### Blueprint title

Air Cleaning Plants

### Idea description

Many households and small businesses find conventional methods of air purification costly, mainly because of the complexity of the various filtration or radiation systems. In addition, their operability may be too complex for most users. On the other hand, incorporating air purification systems into the building environment can be seen as an alternative method for indoor air purification and biological decontamination. Furthermore, the inclusion of biophilic components in the building design also promotes the overall well-being of the users of the physical space. Some studies have even shown that these features provide for faster recovery of patients in hospitals.

### Why?

The use of air-purifying plants is considered a very cost-effective, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method of purifying indoor air and promoting general health, as they absorb a large number of pollutants and microbes in the air. Numerous studies have shown that air purification and biological decontamination are crucial in slowing down the potential transmission of most diseases.

### Contextual situations

Vertical gardening has become very popular in recent years due to its many benefits and has become a great way to aesthetically enhance areas that are considered empty. Specific areas need to be selected that meet most of the requirements for the plants to thrive, and in the case of an advanced system, professionals also need to be involved in the maintenance. This measure offers benefits without a time limit.

### Problems to solve

In terms of health benefits, the inclusion of plants solves a variety of problems that can occur in confined spaces. In other words, problems that could cause what is known as "sick building syndrome", a situation where the users of the space have health problems related to the time they spend in that particular space. More specifically, plants manage to purify the air from various viruses or bacteria, but also from pollutants such as CO2. In addition, plants also regulate indoor humidity and make the users of the space more immune to transmissions.

### Value proposition

To sum up, the benefits described above, including plants in your environment will not only clean your air of hazardous components but will also improve your physical as well as psychological health and make the users feel generally more comfortable in a much more aesthetic environment. For instance, besides the improved recovery of patients, it has also been proved that plants were increasing the performance of students.

### Capabilities

Since plants are our most important companion throughout human existence, we have accumulated a very extensive knowledge about them, which in turn helps us to understand which plants are best suited for the purpose at hand and in which environments they thrive best. In addition, the popularity of vertical gardening has made managing large numbers of plants easier than ever before.

### Restrictions and limitations

Even though the most low-maintenance plants are usually selected for this purpose, they still have to meet their light, climate and growing conditions. In addition, the methods of air purification and transmission control by plants are still being researched and there are currently only a relatively limited number of studies. Finally, the exponential spread of users with allergies must be taken into account when selecting certain plants.
