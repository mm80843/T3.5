## Description

### Blueprint title

Air Cleaning Plants

### Idea description

Many households and small businesses find conventional methods of air purification costly, mainly because of the complexity of the various filtration or radiation systems. In addition, their operability may be too complex for most users. On the other hand, incorporating air purification systems into the building environment can be seen as an alternative method for indoor air purification and biological decontamination. Furthermore, the inclusion of biophilic components in the building design also promotes the overall well-being of the users of the physical space. Some studies have even shown that these features provide for faster recovery of patients in hospitals.

### Why?

Including air cleaning plants is seen as a very cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly method for air purification in confined spaces as well as for the general promotion of healthy functioning by absorbing a large number of pollutants and airborne microbes. Numerous studies have shown that air purification and bio-decontamination are essential for slowing down the potential transmission of most diseases.

### Contextual situations

Vertical gardening has become very popular in recent years due to its many benefits and has become a great way to aesthetically enhance areas that are considered empty. Specific areas need to be selected that meet most of the requirements for the plants to thrive, and in the case of an advanced system, professionals also need to be involved in the maintenance. This measure offers benefits without a time limit.

### Problems to solve

In terms of health benefits, the inclusion of plants solves a variety of problems that can occur in confined spaces. In other words, problems that could cause what is known as "sick building syndrome", a situation where the users of the space have health problems related to the time they spend in that particular space. More specifically, plants manage to purify the air from various viruses or bacteria, but also from pollutants such as CO2. In addition, plants also regulate indoor humidity and make the users of the space more immune to transmissions.

### Value proposition

To sum up, the benefits described above, including plants in your environment will not only clean your air of hazardous components but will also improve your physical as well as psychological health and make the users feel generally more comfortable in a much more aesthetic environment. For instance, besides the improved recovery of patients, it has also been proved that plants were increasing the performance of students.

### Capabilities

Since plants are our most important companion throughout the whole human existence, we have accumulated a very large knowledge base about them which in turn help us understand what plants are the most convenient for this specific use as well as in what environments they strive the most. Moreover, the popularity of vertical gardening technologies made the management of a large number of plants easier than ever before.

### Restrictions and limitations

Even though plants that are simplest to take care of are usually selected for this purpose they still need to meet their lighting, climatic, and growing preconditions. Moreover, methods of air purification and transmission control by plants are still under scrutiny and only a relatively limited number of studies are available at the moment. Last, the exponential spread of users with allergies needs to be taken into account while selecting specific plants.
