## Abstract

Abstract

A direct approach to limit airborne viral transmissions is
to inactivate them within a short time of their production.
Germicidal ultraviolet light, typically at 254 nm, is
effective in this context but, used directly, can be a
health hazard to skin and eyes. By contrast, far-UVC light
(207–222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially
without harm to exposed human tissues. We previously
demonstrated that 222-nm far-UVC light efficiently kills
airborne influenza virus and we extend those studies to
explore far-UVC efficacy against airborne human
coronaviruses alpha HCoV-229E and beta HCoV-OC43. Low doses
of 1.7 and 1.2 mJ/cm 2 inactivated 99.9\% of aerosolized
coronavirus 229E and OC43, respectively. As all human
coronaviruses have similar genomic sizes, far-UVC light
would be expected to show similar inactivation efficiency
against other human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.
Based on the beta-HCoV-OC43 results, continuous far-UVC
exposure in occupied public locations at the current
regulatory exposure limit (\textasciitilde3 mJ/cm 2
/hour) would result in \textasciitilde90\% viral
inactivation in \textasciitilde8 minutes, 95\% in
\textasciitilde11 minutes, 99\% in
\textasciitilde16 minutes and 99.9\% inactivation in
\textasciitilde25 minutes. Thus while staying within
current regulatory dose limits, low-dose-rate far-UVC
exposure can potentially safely provide a major reduction
in the ambient level of airborne coronaviruses in occupied
public locations.
