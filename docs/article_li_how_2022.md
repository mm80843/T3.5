## Abstract

5G, the most disruptive innovation, had played a
significant role in the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and
control. However, as a novel technology and context, we
have little knowledge about how 5G enabled pandemic
prevention and control. This study collected 212 cases and
conducted qualitative research to explore how the 5G worked
in prevention and control. Based on the concepts of
materiality and affordance, we grounded two affordances of
spatialization and de-spatialization from the data.
Spatialization provides non-contact ways to complete the
tasks which are supposed to be completed in contact, and
de-spatialization provides remote operations to complete
the tasks which are supposed to be completed on-site.
Spatialization and de-spatialization enabled the diagnosis
and treatment of the infectors to relieve the unbalance of
medical staff, cutting the infectious route to contain the
viral spread, and logistic supply to support the prevention
and control. Our study offers theoretical contributions to
digital pandemic prevention and control, and the literature
on 5G also offers practical implications.
