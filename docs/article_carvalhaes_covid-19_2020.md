* Year: 2020
* Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked infrastructure systems
in unanticipated ways. Seemingly in the course of weeks,
our demands for many basic and critical services have
radically shifted. With expected long-term effects (i.e.,
years), COVID-19 is going to have profound impacts on every
facet of infrastructure systems, and will shock these
systems very differently than the hazards that we often
focus on, such as extreme events, disrepair, and terrorist
attacks. At the beginning of this pandemic, infrastructure
managers are scrambling to respond to changes in demand,
and to understand what the long-term effects are for how
they operate and maintain their systems. We contend that
COVID-19 is revealing several important limitations to how
we approach and manage our infrastructure, that must be
acknowledged and addressed as the pandemic persists, and in
a future increasingly characterized by accelerating and
increasingly uncertain conditions. These limitations are
how (i) we prepare for concurrent hazards, (ii) frame
criticality based on traditional infrastructure sectors and
not human capabilities, (iii) we emphasize efficiency at a
cost to resilience, and (iv) leadership is largely focused
on stable conditions. Each of these challenges represents a
call for major rethinking for how we approach
infrastructure, and COVID-19 presents a window of
opportunity for change.
