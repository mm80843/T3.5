## Description


### Blueprint title

Acces to green space

### Idea description

This blueprint aims to integrate access to green space into GBN in order to improve or maintain the mental health status of GBN users. The term green space is usually defined as open, undeveloped land with natural vegetation, but is also used in other forms such as urban parks and public open spaces, as well as street trees and green spaces. The use of green space has been associated with numerous health benefits in intervention and observational studies, demonstrating a positive impact of green space on a wide range of health outcomes.

### Why?

Numerous studies have found a link between spending time in green spaces and nature and stress reduction, better mood, higher life satisfaction, mental stimulation and a lower risk of mental health problems.

### Contextual situations

Access to green space in urban areas such as a GBN is important and useful under normal conditions, but it is of even greater importance at times when the mental health of the population is under pressure, as was the case during the COVID 19 pandemic.

### Problems to solve

Improving or maintaining the mental health of GBN users.

### Value proposition

This measure aims to maintain or improve the good mental health of GBN users and does not address the prevention of the spread of disease. Access to green spaces has a whole range of benefits and is central to many urban projects.

### Capabilities

In addition to the mental health aspects, there may be a number of other derived effects of green spaces, such as positive impacts on biodiversity, enhancement of overall quality and pricing of the area. In terms of a COVID 19 pandemic, green spaces would also provide opportunities for outdoor activities during times when people are resting indoors.
