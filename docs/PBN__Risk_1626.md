# RISK: __Lack of standardized method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in environmental samples__ (PBN__Risk_1626)

## Property: has_RiskGBN

* [Yes](PBN__RiskGBN_1)

## Property: has_RiskName

The lack of a standardized method makes it challenging to interpret and compare the results of studies on SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and other environmental samples.

## Property: has_RiskDescription

The absence of a standardized method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and other environmental samples can result in inconsistencies in the data and hinder comparisons between studies.
