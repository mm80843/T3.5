## Details of the blueprint

### Blueprint title

Public places as information points

### Idea description

The idea is to transform high occupancy points into nodes where people can see relevant information such as guideline, regulations...It’s allows to share key informations to a maximum people in the shortest time possible. Indeed, a key information like new rules (Curfew, lockdown) but also delivery of basic necessities as logistics has been strongly impacted during the last crisis

### Why?

To ensure information reaches all people. 
Due to the safety measures depend on level of incidence, which is very changeable, it is difficult to keep up to date

Communicate well the good information to a maximum of people, without difficulty will allow people to know quick the key information and to have a direct impact on the local epidemic regulation

### Contextual situations

Entry and exit points, intersections, waiting areas, public transport...
The measure is conceived for building users and general public
Need for a physical space in the building to locate the screens...
Informations can be displayed on the commune doors, elevators… 
Smartphones applications. 
Communication between neighbors

### Problems to solve

Misinformation
Lack of confidence / trust
Find a way to make the information accessible for everyone. 
Increase the communication between neighbors.

### Value proposition

Information reaches everyone: Real time information thanks to the DT and smartphones. Indeed, the DT is a collaborative tool and habitants can use the DT to have information, about the building. So it’s important to integrate emergency information inside, and particulary health information like epidemiologic regulation rules.
Moreover, viruses can spread more easily depending on the quality of the air in the building. Thanks to the DT, it will be possible to inform the habitant on their air quality in their flat and air the room when necessary for example
Information through different channels

### Capabilities

Large screens and other augmented methods
A kind of “Whatsapp” groups when the number of habitants of one building is not so important. 
Mobile app. with alert and notifications  with access to the DT to check information about air quality, and key informations.

### Restrictions and limitations

People can ignore the messages. The message has to be clear about is importance. A specific graphic charter has to be created to report the information in the message
Repetitive messages
Messages not adapted to all audiences
Out of date information
Educate residents on the use of the DT to limit the good conditions for the spread of the virus

### Transmission

### Scale

GBN

### Phase

Design

### Demonstrated

### Permanent
