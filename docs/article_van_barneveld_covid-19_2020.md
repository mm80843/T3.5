## Abstract

This discussion paper by a group of scholars across the
fields of health, economics and labour relations argues
that COVID-19 is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis from
which there can be no return to the ‘old normal’. The
pandemic’s disastrous worldwide health impacts have been
exacerbated by, and have compounded, the unsustainability
of economic globalisation based on the neoliberal
dismantling of state capabilities in favour of markets.
Flow-on economic impacts have simultaneously created major
supply and demand disruptions, and highlighted the growing
within-country inequalities and precarity generated by
neoliberal regimes of labour market regulation. Taking an
Australian and international perspective, we examine these
economic and labour market impacts, paying particular
attention to differential impacts on First Nations people,
developing countries, women, immigrants and young people.
Evaluating policy responses in a political climate of
national and international leadership very different from
those in which major twentieth century crises were
addressed, we argue the need for a national and
international conversation to develop a new pathway out of
crisis. JEL Codes: E18, HO, I1, J64, J88
