## Description

### Blueprint title

Tender support at building stage

### Idea description

With the COVID-19 a new agenda in the built environment has been introduced: Epidemic adaptation and mitigation. This leads to a new approach to building design and operation, where the current maturity level is low and relatively unexplored. The idea is to establish a template of tender elements in relation to epidemic adaptation and mitigation that building- or area owners can use in the procurement process to ensure a higher level of inclusion of epidemic adaptation and mitigation measures.

### Why?

Tender documentation is needed by the project owner to express their needs and requirements to their supply chain. 
A lack of knowledge can lead to forgetting or exclusion of important elements in the design stage and thereby focus or due to the lack of insight into proper measures.

### Contextual situations

Developers will be subject to forthcoming regulations and standards relating to health in facilities and must be able to demonstrate a world-class approach to epidemiological risk.
This can be considered in the early stages of the project when submitting procurement documents.
Standards for the dissemination of information about the building and DT can be produced.
Specifications can be drawn up for air circulation, to which buildings must conform 
The entrance and common spaces can be adapted in their functionality and size.

### Problems to solve

A lack of knowledge can lead to forgetting or exclusion of important elements in the design stage . 

Tightly packed buildings, too much interaction in common areas, insufficient ventilation during epidemicsâ€¦ This kind of probleme have to be integrated even before the start of the project.

### Value proposition

The value proposition of the Blueprint is to provide basic elements that procurement teams can build into their procurement process.
This includes, for example, binding information for suppliers and subcontractors.
The risks of virus proliferation need to be explained so that everyone involved understands what is at stake in their integration.
Examples of improvement solutions must then be proposed

### Capabilities

This builds on the regulation and procurement capabilities of the developers / purchaser of services.

### Restrictions and limitations

This basic procurement packs do not exist yet.
This could be a further development for Probono.
Budgetary issues are the main obstacle. The cheapest solution can take advantage of the safest one in terms of epidemiology in the absence of a binding standard
