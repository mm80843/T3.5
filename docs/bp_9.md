## Description

### Blueprint title

Tender support at building stage

### Idea description

With the COVID-19 a new agenda in the built environment has been introduced: Epidemic adaptation and mitigation. This leads to a new approach to building design and operation, where the current maturity level is low and relatively unexplored. The idea is to establish a template of tender elements in relation to epidemic adaptation and mitigation that building- or area owners can use in the procurement process to ensure a higher level of inclusion of epidemic adaptation and mitigation measures.

### Why?

Tender documentation is needed by the project owner to express their needs and requirements to their supply chain. 
A lack of knowledge can lead to forgetting or exclusion of important elements in the design stage and thereby focus or due to the lack of insight into proper measures.

### Contextual situations

Developers will be subject to upcoming regulations and norms related to health in assets, and before, to be able to demonstrate a best in class approach to the epidemiology risks.
This can be included in the early phases of the project when submitting procurement documentations.
Norms can be created about the information’s diffusion insight the building, and with the DT.
Air circulation specification can be created and building will have to adapt themselves to it. 
The entry and the commun party can be readapted in their functionality and in their dimension.

### Problems to solve

A lack of knowledge can lead to forgetting or exclusion of important elements in the design stage . 

Tightly packed buildings, too much interaction in common areas, insufficient ventilation during epidemics… This kind of probleme have to be integrated even before the start of the project.

### Value proposition

The Blueprint VP is to provide basic elements that procurement teams can include in their procurement process.
These would contain for example prescriptive information for suppliers and subcontractors.
The risks of virus diffusion must be explained so that each actor understands the stakes of their integration.
Examples of improvement solutions must be proposed afterwards

### Capabilities

This builds on the regulation and procurement capabilities of the developers / purchaser of services.

### Restrictions and limitations

This basic procurement packs do not exist yet.
This could be a further development for Probono.
Budgetary issues are the main obstacle. The cheapest solution can take advantage of the safest one in terms of epidemiology in the absence of a binding standard
