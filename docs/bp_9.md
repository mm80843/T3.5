# Blueprint: __Rotating groups at work, school best against COVID-19 spread: Study__ (BP_9)


## Details

* Cluster: __processing-wireless__ ([Cluster_1](cluster_1))



## Description


### Blueprint title

Tender support at building stage

### Idea description

The COVID -19 introduced a new agenda for the built environment: epidemic adaptation and mitigation. This leads to a new approach to building design and operation, the maturity of which is currently low and relatively unexplored. The idea is to create a template with RFP elements related to epidemic adaptation and mitigation that building or space owners can use in the procurement process to ensure a higher level of incorporation of epidemic adaptation and mitigation measures.

### Why?

Tender documents are needed by the project owner to formulate its needs and requirements for its supply chain 
Lack of knowledge can lead to important elements being forgotten or omitted at the design stage, resulting in a lack of focus or insight into appropriate actions.

### Contextual situations

Developers will be subject to forthcoming regulations and standards relating to health in facilities and must be able to demonstrate a world-class approach to epidemiological risk.
This can be considered in the early stages of the project when submitting procurement documents.
Standards for the dissemination of information about the building and DT can be produced.
Specifications can be drawn up for air circulation, to which buildings must conform 
The entrance and common spaces can be adapted in their functionality and size.

### Problems to solve

Lack of knowledge can lead to forgetting or excluding important elements in the design phase 

Densely packed buildings, too much interaction in common areas, inadequate ventilation during epidemics... These types of problems must be considered before the project begins.

### Value proposition

The value proposition of the Blueprint is to provide basic elements that procurement teams can build into their procurement process.
This includes, for example, binding information for suppliers and subcontractors.
The risks of virus proliferation need to be explained so that everyone involved understands what is at stake in their integration.
Examples of improvement solutions must then be proposed

### Capabilities

This is based on the regulatory and procurement capabilities of developers/buyers of services.

### Restrictions and limitations

These basic procurement packages do not yet exist.
This could be another development for Probono.
Budgetary issues are the main obstacle. In the absence of a mandatory standard, the cheapest solution may be the safest in terms of epidemiology
