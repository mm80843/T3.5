## Details of the blueprint

### Blueprint title

Access limitation

### Idea description

For this, the respect of certain rules of social distancing is essential to avoid any contamination while allowing the inhabitants to go out. Some solutions can be already thought as :
-	Limit the time spent in the area .. well implemented in the past
-	Control the number of people entering a certain area at a given time.

### Why?

Controlling access is one of the key points to limit the spread of a virus. in particular because : 
-	By limiting access nodes/points we have a better overview of human circulation
-	We can better monitor the ins and outs
We can have a safe and comfortable occupancy level

### Contextual situations

The context of application of the access restrictions are the following:
-	Peak hour : How to manage the danger at this moment? 
-	Opening hour : How to reduce the opening hour ? 
-	Customer selection ?
-	More personalised service ? 
This context problematics has to be applied to all people who enter in the building. 
An particular attention has to be made at access nodes of public buildings. 
The design phase has to integrate also the risk in their study.

### Problems to solve

The measure avoids overcrowding
It allows people who are in the building to maintain a distance which is totally immune to person-to-person transmissions

### Value proposition

Different solution can be created to limit access : 
-	Control over occupancy level
-	Control over critic parameters
-	Greater quality service
-	Greater planning
-	Diversification of customer service channels

### Capabilities

Thanks to the technology and the Digital twin, the capabilities of controlling the access and the flow of people can improve a lot. Different solution can be imagined : 
-	Sensors to monitor occupancy
-	Telephone service
-	Remote assistance as alternative
-	Appointment booking system
-	Smart people counter
-	Contactless login / access (badges)

### Restrictions and limitations

Limiting access is above all a deprivation of movement, of freedom for the inhabitants. The acceptance of the inhabitants is the first obstacle.
As well as some logistical issues that can be difficult to implement, such as changing the opening hours or the barriers to accessing services. 
Moreover there may be circumstances where we can not limit access nodes. 
Emergencies can be complicated to manage : unforeseen situations which require immediate attention
Finally , the last point is downtime if the customer does not appear.

### Transmission

Direct & Indirect

### Scale

Building

### Phase

Design & Operational

### Demonstrated

Access limitation was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic

### Permanent

Temporary

### Technical or behavioural

Technical & Behavioural

### Use of Digital Twin

A digital twin could be used to visualise how to optimise the access limitation in a building without entirely compromising the circulation with its structure

### Adverse costs
